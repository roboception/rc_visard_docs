Load carrier
------------

A load carrier (bin) is a container with four walls, a floor and a rectangular rim,
which can contain objects. It can be used to limit the volume in which to search
for objects or grasp points. 

A load carrier is defined by its ``outer_dimensions`` and ``inner_dimensions``.
The maximum ``outer_dimensions`` are 2.0 meters in every dimension.

The origin of the load carrier reference frame is in the center of the load carrier
*outer* box and its z axis is perpendicular to the load carrier floor 
pointing outwards (see :numref:`fig-loadcarrier-load-carrier`).

.. _fig-loadcarrier-load-carrier:
.. figure:: images/itempick_load_carrier_reference.*
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Load carrier with reference frame and inner and outer dimensions

.. Note::
  Typically, outer and inner dimensions of a load carrier are available in the
  specifications of the load carrier manufacturer.

.. The ``outer_dimensions`` identify the load carrier outer box and
.. are the dimensions of the load carrier bounding box.
.. The ``inner_dimensions`` identify the load carrier inner box and
.. are the dimension of the maximum box that can be completely
.. contained within the load carrier.
.. While the ``rim_thickness`` value is optionally used for detecting the load carrier,
.. the ``inner_dimensions`` are required to filter the load carrier
.. and keep only its content.

The inner volume of the load carrier is defined by its inner dimensions, but includes a region 
of 10 cm height above the load carrier, so that also items protruding from the load carrier 
are considered for detection or grasp computation. Furthermore, an additional
``crop_distance`` is subtracted from the inner volume in every dimension, which acts as a safety margin and can 
be configured as run-time parameter (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier-parameters`:latex:`, Section 
\ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier-parameters})`).
:numref:`fig-loadcarrier-inside-volume` visualizes the inner volume of a load carrier. Only 
points which are inside this volume are considered for detections.

.. _fig-loadcarrier-inside-volume:
.. figure:: images/load_carrier_inside_volume.*
  :width: 50%
  :align: center

  Visualization of the inner volume of a load carrier. Only 
  points which are inside this volume are considered for detections.  

The |rcxxx| can persistently store up to 50 different
load carrier models, each one identified by a different ``id``.
The configuration of a load carrier model is normally performed offline,
during the set up the desired application.
This can be done via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` or in the |rcxxx| |webgui|.

.. Note::
  The configured load carrier models
  are persistent even over firmware updates and rollbacks.

.. _sect-loadcarrier-compartment:

Load carrier compartments
-------------------------

.. index::
   pair: load carrier; compartment

Some detection modules can make use of a ``load_carrier_compartment`` to further limit the volume for the detection,
for example :ref:`ItemPick's compute_grasps service<expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps>`:latex:`\:(see \ref{itempick:expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps})`.
A load carrier compartment is a box whose ``pose`` is defined as the transformation from the load carrier reference frame to the compartment 
reference frame, which is located in the center of the compartment box (see :numref:`fig-loadcarrier-compartment`).

.. _fig-loadcarrier-compartment:
.. figure:: images/itempick_load_carrier_compartment.*
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Sample compartment inside a load carrier. The coordinate frame shown in the image is the
   reference frame of the compartment.

The compartment volume is intersected with the load carrier inner volume to compute the volume for the detection. 
If this intersection should also contain the 10 cm region above the load carrier, the height of the compartment box
must be increased accordingly.

.. _sect-loadcarrier-detect-lc:

Detection of load carriers
--------------------------

.. index::
   pair: load carrier; detection

The load carrier detection algorithm is based on the detection of the load carrier's
rectangular rim. By default, the rectangular ``rim_thickness`` is computed from the
outer and inner dimensions. As an alternative, its value can also
be explicitly specified by the user.

The detection algorithm returns the pose of the load carrier's origin 
(see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier-definition`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier-definition}`)
in the desired pose frame.

The detection functionality also determines if the detected load carrier is ``overfilled``,
which means, that objects protrude from the plane defined by the load carrier rim.

.. _fig-loadcarrier-load-carrier-models:
.. figure:: images/itempick_load_carrier_reference_rim_sidebyside.*
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Load carrier models and reference frames

The user can optionally specify a prior for the load carrier ``pose``.
The detected load carrier pose is guaranteed to have the minimum rotation
with respect to the load carrier prior pose.
If no prior is specified, the algorithm searches for a load carrier whose floor
is perpendicular to the estimated gravity vector.

.. Because of the symmetry of the load carrier model, there is an ambiguity
.. in the definition of the x axis sense.
.. :numref:`fig-loadcarrier-load-carrier-orientation` visualizes how the sense of
.. the load carrier x axis is defined for rectangular load carriers.

..    All load carrier are viewed from the left eye of the |rc_visard|.
..    The dashed line represents the orientation where the x axis flips
..    (-45 degrees on the image plane).

.. _sect-loadcarrier-detect-filling-level:

Detection of filling level
--------------------------

.. index::
   pair: BoxPick; filling level
   pair: ItemPick; filling level
   pair: SilhouetteMatch; filling level
   pair: LoadCarrier; filling level

.. only:: rc_cube

   .. index::
      single: CADMatch; filling level

The LoadCarrier module offers the ``detect_filling_level``
service to compute the filling level of a detected load carrier.

The load carrier is subdivided in a configurable number of cells in a 2D grid.
The maximum number of cells is 10x10.
For each cell, the following values are reported:

- ``level_in_percent``: minimum, maximum and mean cell filling level in percent
  from the load carrier floor.
  These values can be larger than 100% if the cell is overfilled.
- ``level_free_in_meters``: minimum, maximum and mean cell free level in meters
  from the load carrier rim. These values can be negative if the cell is overfilled.
- ``cell_size``: dimensions of the 2D cell in meters.
- ``cell_position``: position of the cell center in meters
  (either in ``camera`` or ``external`` frame, see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier-hand-eye-dep`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier-hand-eye-dep}`).
  The z-coordinate is on the level of the load carrier rim.
- ``coverage``: represents the proportion of valid pixels in this cell.
  It varies between 0 and 1 with steps of 0.1.
  A low coverage indicates that the cell contains several missing data
  (i.e. only a few points were actually measured in this cell).

These values are also calculated for the whole load carrier itself.
If no cell subdivision is specified, only the overall filling level is computed.

.. _fig-loadcarrier-lc-filling-level:
.. figure:: images/itempick_lc_filling_level.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Visualizations of the load carrier filling level: overall filling level without
   grid (left), 4x3 grid (center), 8x8 grid (right).
   The load carrier content is shown in a green gradient from white
   (on the load carrier floor) to dark green.
   The overfilled regions are visualized in red. Numbers indicate cell IDs.

.. _sect-loadcarrier-dependencies:

Interaction with other modules
------------------------------

Internally, the LoadCarrier module depends on, and interacts with other on-board
modules as listed below.

.. Note::
  All changes and configuration updates to these modules will affect
  the performance of the LoadCarrier module.

.. For each load carrier detection, the LoadCarrier module
.. acquires datasets of synchronized images and estimates the gravity vector.
.. The data acquisition step normally takes between 500 ms and 600 ms
.. with "High" depth image quality.

.. _sect-loadcarrier-stereo-camera-matching:

Stereo camera and Stereo matching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The LoadCarrier module makes internally use of the following data:

- Rectified images from the :doc:`stereo_camera` module
  (``rc_stereocamera``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-stereo-camera}`);

- Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`stereo_matching` module
  (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`).

All processed images are guaranteed to be captured after the module trigger time.

.. _sect-loadcarrier-dynamics:

Estimation of gravity vector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each load carrier detection, the module
estimates the gravity vector by subscribing to the |rc_visard|'s IMU data stream.

.. Note::
   The gravity vector is estimated from linear acceleration readings from the on-board IMU.
   For this reason, the LoadCarrier module requires the |rc_visard| to remain
   still while the gravity vector is being estimated.

.. _sect-loadcarrier-iocontrol-dep:

IO and Projector Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the |rc_xxx| is used in conjunction with an external random dot 
projector and the :doc:`iocontrol` module (``rc_iocontrol``:latex:`, 
Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol}`), it is recommended to connect 
the projector to GPIO Out 1 and set the stereo-camera module's 
acquisition mode to ``SingleFrameOut1`` (see :ref:`Stereo matching 
parameters<sect-disp-image-parameters>`:latex:`, Section 
\ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters})`, so that on each 
image acquisition trigger an image with and without projector pattern is 
acquired.

Alternatively, the output mode for the GPIO output in use should be set 
to ``ExposureAlternateActive`` (see :ref:`sect-iocontrol-params`:latex:`,
Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol-params}`).

In either case,
the *Auto Exposure Mode* ``exp_auto_mode`` should be set to ``AdaptiveOut1`` to optimize the exposure
of both images (see :ref:`Stereo camera parameters<sect-cam-params>`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params})`.

No additional changes are required to use the LoadCarrier module
in combination with a random dot projector.

.. _sect-loadcarrier-hand-eye-dep:

Hand-eye calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the loadcarrier module
can automatically provide poses in the robot coordinate frame.
For the loadcarrier nodes' :ref:`sect-loadcarrier-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier-services})`, the frame of the
output poses can be controlled with the ``pose_frame`` argument.

Two different ``pose_frame`` values can be chosen:

1. **Camera frame** (``camera``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the camera frame,
   and no prior knowledge about the pose of the camera in the environment is required.
   This means that the configured load carriers move with the camera.
   It is the user's responsibility to update the configured poses
   if the camera frame moves (e.g. with a robot-mounted camera).

2. **External frame** (``external``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the external frame,
   configured by the user during the hand-eye calibration process.
   The module relies on the on-board 
   :doc:`Hand-eye calibration module<handeye_calibration>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})`
   to retrieve the sensor mounting (static or robot mounted) and
   the hand-eye transformation.
   If the mounting is static, no further information is needed.
   If the sensor is robot-mounted, the ``robot_pose`` is required
   to transform poses to and from the ``external`` frame.

.. Note::
   If no hand-eye calibration is available, all ``pose_frame`` values should be set to ``camera``.

All ``pose_frame`` values that are not ``camera`` or ``external`` are rejected.

.. _sect-loadcarrier-parameters:

Parameters
----------

.. index::
   single: LoadCarrier; parameters

The LoadCarrier module is called ``rc_load_carrier``
in the |rest-api| and is used internally by several other modules. 
The user can explore and configure the LoadCarrier
module's run-time parameter, e.g. for development and testing, using the
*LoadCarrier* page under the *Modules* tab in the 
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`,
or the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`.

Description of run-time parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each run-time parameter is represented by a row on the *LoadCarrier Settings* section 
of the |webgui|'s *LoadCarrier* page.
The name in the |webgui| is given in brackets behind the parameter name and the parameters are
listed in the order they appear in the |webgui|. The parameters are prefixed with ``load_carrier_``
when they are used outside the ``rc_load_carrier`` module from another detection module
using the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`.

.. _expl-loadcarrier-model-tolerance:

``model_tolerance`` (*Model Tolerance*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    indicates how much the estimated load carrier dimensions are allowed to differ from the load carrier model dimensions in meters.

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

    .. code-block:: bash

       PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_load_carrier/parameters?model_tolerance=<value>

.. _expl-loadcarrier-crop-distance:

``crop_distance`` (*Crop Distance*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    sets the safety margin in meters by which the load carrier's inner dimensions are
    reduced to define the region of interest for detection (ref. :numref:`fig-loadcarrier-inside-volume`).

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

    .. code-block:: bash

       PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_load_carrier/parameters?crop_distance=<value>

.. _sect-loadcarrier-services:

Services
--------

.. index::
   single: LoadCarrier; services

The user can explore and call the LoadCarrier module's services,
e.g. for development and testing, using the
:doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` or
the |rc_xxx|
:ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})` on the
*LoadCarrier* page under the *Modules* tab.

Each service response contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.
The smaller value is selected in case a service has multiple ``return_code`` values,
but all messages are appended in the ``return_code`` message.

The following table contains a list of common codes:

.. tabularcolumns:: |c|L|
.. _tab-loadcarrier-return-codes:
