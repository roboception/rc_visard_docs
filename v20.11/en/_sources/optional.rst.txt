Optional software components

The

rc_visard

 offers optional software components that can be activated by
purchasing a separate

license

.

The

rc_visard

's optional software consists of the following components:

SLAM (rc_slam, Section \ref{slam:sect-slam})  performs simultaneous
localization and mapping for correcting accumulated poses. The
rc_visard's covered trajectory is offered via the REST-API
interface\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api}).

ItemPick and BoxPick (rc_itempick and rc_boxpick, Section
\ref{itempick:sect-itempick})  provides an out-of-the-box perception
solution for robotic pick-and-place applications of unknown objects or
boxes.

SilhouetteMatch (rc_silhouettematch, Section \ref{silhouettematch
:sect-silhouettematch})  provides an object detection solution for
objects placed on a plane.

CollisionCheck (rc_collision_check, Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-
collision})  provides an easy way to check if a gripper is in
collision with load carrier.

The

rc_visard

 provides some common functionalities which are used in multiple
optional software components. The common functionalities are:

Load carrier functionality\:(Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-
loadcarrier})  allows setting and retrieving load carriers, as well as
detecting load carriers and their filling level.

Region of interest functionality\:(Section \ref{roi:sect-roi})  allows
setting and retrieving 3D regions of interest.
