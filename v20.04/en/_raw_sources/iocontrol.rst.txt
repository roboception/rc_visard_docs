IO and Projector Control
========================

The IOControl component allows reading the status of the general purpose
digital inputs and controlling the digital general purpose outputs (GPIOs)
of the |rc_visard|.
The outputs can be set to LOW or HIGH,
or configured to be HIGH for the exposure time of every image or every second image.

The purpose of the IOControl component is the control of an external light source
or a projector, which is connected to one of the |rc_visard|'s GPIOs to be
synchronized by the image acquisition trigger.
In case a pattern projector is used to improve stereo matching, the intensity images
also show the projected pattern, which might be a disadvantage for image processing
tasks that are based on the intensity image (e.g. edge detection). For this reason,
the IOControl component allows setting GPIO outputs to HIGH for the exposure time of 
every second image, so that intensity images without the projected pattern are also available.

   .. Note:: For more details on the |rc_visard|'s GPIOs please refer to
             :ref:`sect-wiring`:latex:`, Section \ref{hardware_spec:sect-wiring}`.

.. Note::

   The IOControl component is optional and requires the purchase of a separate
   :ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})`.

.. _sect-iocontrol-parameters:

Parameters
----------

The IOControl component is called ``rc_iocontrol`` in the |rest-api| and is represented by the 
*IOControl* page in the *Modules* tab of the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`.
The user can change the parameters via the |webgui|, the 
:doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`, or via GigE Vision
using the DigitalIOControl parameters ``LineSelector`` and ``LineSource``
(:ref:`sect-genicam-iocontrol`:latex:`, Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam-iocontrol}`).

Parameter overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: _gen/nodes/params/rc_iocontrol.txt

.. _sect-iocontrol-params:

Description of run-time parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``out1_mode`` and ``out2_mode`` (*Out1* and *Out2*)
    The output modes for GPIO Out 1 and Out 2 can be set individually:

    ``Low`` sets the ouput permanently to LOW. This is the factory default of GPIO Out 2.

    ``High`` sets the output permanently to HIGH.

    ``ExposureActive`` sets the output to HIGH for the exposure time of every
    image. This is the factory default of GPIO Out 1.

    ``ExposureAlternateActive`` sets the output to HIGH for the exposure time
    of every second image.

.. Note::

   The parameters can only be changed if the IOControl license is available on
   the |rc_xxx|. Otherwise, the parameters will stay at their factory
   defaults, i.e. ``out1_mode`` = ``ExposureActive`` and ``out2_mode`` = ``Low``.

:numref:`fig-fps-exposure` shows which images are used for stereo
matching and transmission via GigE Vision in ``ExposureActive`` mode with a
user-defined frame rate of 8 Hz.

.. _fig-fps-exposure:
.. figure:: images/fps_exposure.*
   :width: 100 %
   :align: center

   Example of using the ``ExposureActive`` mode for GPIO Out 1 with a user-defined
   frame rate of 8 Hz. The internal image acquisition is always |cam-rate|.
   GPIO Out 1 is HIGH for the exposure time of every image. A disparity
   image is computed for camera images that are sent out via GigE Vision according
   to the user-defined frame rate.

The mode ``ExposureAlternateActive`` is meant to be used when an external random
dot projector is connected to the |rc_visard|'s GPIO Out 1.
When setting Out 1 to ``ExposureAlternateActive``, the
:ref:`stereo matching<sect-stereo-matching>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching})`
component only uses images with GPIO Out 1 being HIGH, i.e. projector is on. The maximum
frame rate that is used for stereo matching is therefore half of the frame rate
configured by the user
(see :ref:`FPS<expl-fps>`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`). All
components which make use of the intensity image, like
:ref:`TagDetect<sect-tag-detection>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{tagdetect:sect-tag-detection})` and
:ref:`ItemPick<sect-itempick>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick})`,
use the intensity images with GPIO Out 1 being LOW, i.e. projector is off.
:numref:`fig-fps-alternate` shows an example.

.. _fig-fps-alternate:
.. figure:: images/fps_alternate.*
   :width: 100 %
   :align: center

   Example of using the ``ExposureAlternateActive`` mode for GPIO Out 1 with a
   user-defined frame rate of 8 Hz. The internal image acquisition is always |cam-rate|.
   GPIO Out 1 is HIGH for the exposure time of every second image. A disparity
   image is computed for images where Out 1 is HIGH and that are sent out via GigE
   Vision according to the user-defined frame rate. In ``ExposureAlternateActive``
   mode, intensity images are always transmitted pairwise: one with GPIO Out 1 HIGH, for which a
   disparity image might be available, and one with GPIO Out 1 LOW.

.. Note:: In ``ExposureAlternateActive`` mode, an intensity image with GPIO Out 1 being HIGH (i.e. with
   projection) is always 40 ms away from an intensity image with Out 1 being LOW (i.e. without
   projection), regardless of the user-defined frame rate. This needs to be
   considered when synchronizing disparity images and camera images without projection
   in this special mode.

The functionality can also be controlled by the DigitalIOControl parameters
of the GenICam interface (:ref:`sect-genicam-iocontrol`:latex:`, Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam-iocontrol}`).


.. _sect-iocontrol-services:

Services
--------

Each service response contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.

The IOControl component offers the following services.

``get_io_values``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This service call retrieves the current state of the |rc_visard|'s general purpose inputs
   and outputs (GPIOs). 

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_iocontrol_get_io_values.txt

   The returned ``timestamp`` is the time of measurement. 

   ``return_code`` holds possible warnings or error codes and messages.
   Possible ``return_code`` values are shown below.

   .. tabularcolumns:: |c|L|
   .. csv-table::
       :header:  Code, Description

       "0",  "Success"
       "-2", "Internal error"
       "-9", "License for `IOControl` is not available"

``save_parameters``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   With this service call, the component's current parameter settings are
   persisted to the |rcxxx|. That means, these values are applied even after
   reboot.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_iocontrol_save_parameters.txt

``reset_defaults``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Restores and applies the default values for this component's parameters
   ("factory reset").

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_iocontrol_reset_defaults.txt

   .. WARNING:: The user must be aware that calling this service causes the
      current parameter settings for the IOControl component to be
      irrecoverably lost.
