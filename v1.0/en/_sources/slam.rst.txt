SLAM (optional)

The SLAM module is part of the sensor dynamics component. When the

rc_visard

 moves through the world, its pose estimate slowly accumulates errors
over time. The SLAM module can correct these pose errors by
recognizing previously visited places.

The acronym SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. The
SLAM module creates a map consisting of the image features used in
visual odometry. The map is later used to correct accumulated pose
errors. This is most apparent in applications where the robot returns
to a previously visited place after covering a large distance (this is
called a “loop closure”). In this case, the robot can redetect image
features that are already stored in its map and can use this
information to correct the pose estimate.  When closing a loop, not
only the current pose, but also the past pose estimates (the
trajectory of the

rc_visard

), are corrected. Continuous trajectory correction leads to a more
accurate map. On the other hand, the accuracy of the full trajectory
is important when it is used to build an integrated world model, e.g.,
by projecting the obtained 3D point clouds obtained (see

Computing depth images and point clouds

) into a common coordinate frame. The full trajectory can be requested
from the SLAM module for this purpose.

The SLAM module will be optionally available for the

rc_visard

 and will run on board the sensor. If a SLAM license is stored on the

rc_visard

, then the SLAM module is shown as
