ItemPick

The ItemPick component is an optional component that runs on board the

rc_visard

. It provides an out-of-the-box perception solution for robotic pick-
and-place applications with suction grippers. ItemPick computes
possible grasp poses for the suction device. Each suggested grasp
includes a quality value related to the surface available for
grasping. Visualization streams are available for parameter
configuration and application tuning.

ItemPick is also ready to be used for bin-picking applications. It
offers a load carrier detection solution to provide grasps for items
inside the load carrier.

The ItemPick component works with both static and robot-mounted

rc_visard

 devices and can optionally be combined with the on-board

Hand-eye calibration

  component to provide grasp poses in the user-configured external
reference frame.

Note: The ItemPick component is optional and requires a separate

  license

    to be purchased.
