SilhouetteMatch

Introduction

The SilhouetteMatch component is an optional on-board component of the

rc_visard

, which detects objects by matching a predefined silhouette
(“template”) to edges in an image.

Note: This component is optional and requires a separate
  SilhouetteMatch

  license

    to be purchased.

For the SilhouetteMatch component to work, special object templates
are required for each type of object to be detected. Roboception
offers a template generation service on their

website

, where the user can upload CAD files or recorded data of the objects
and request object templates for the SilhouetteMatch component.

The object templates consist of significant edges of each object.
These template edges are matched to the edges detected in the left and
right camera images, considering the actual size of the objects and
their distance from the camera. The poses of the detected objects are
returned and can be used for grasping, for example.

Suitable objects

The SilhouetteMatch component is intended for objects which have
significant edges on a common plane that is parallel to the base plane
on which the objects are placed. This applies to flat, nontransparent
objects, such as routed, laser-cut or water-cut 2D parts and flat-
machined parts. More complex parts can also be detected if there are
significant edges on a common plane, e.g. a special pattern printed on
a flat surface.

The SilhouetteMatch component works best for objects on a texture-free
base plane. The color of the base plane should be chosen such that a
clear contrast between the objects and the base plane appears in the
intensity image.

Suitable scene

The scene must meet the following conditions to be suitable for the
SilhouetteMatch component:

The objects to be detected must be suitable for the SilhouetteMatch
component as described above.

Only objects belonging to one specific template are visible at a time
(unmixed scenario). In case other objects are visible as well, a
proper region of interest (ROI) must be set.

All visible objects are lying on a common base plane, which has to be
calibrated.

The offset between the base plane normal and the camera's line of
sight does not exceed 10 degrees.

The objects are not partially or fully occluded.

All visible objects are right side up (no flipped objects).

The object edges to be matched are visible in both, left and right
camera images.

Base-plane calibration

Before objects can be detected, a base-plane calibration must be
performed. Thereby, the distance and angle of the plane on which the
objects are placed is measured and stored persistently on the

rc_visard

.

Separating the detection of the base plane from the actual object
detection renders scenarios possible in which the base plane is
temporarily occluded. Moreover, it increases performance of the object
detection for scenarios where the base plane is fixed for a certain
time; thus, it is not necessary to continuously re-detect the base
plane.

The base-plane calibration can be performed in three different ways,
which will be explained in more detail further down:

AprilTag based

Stereo based

Manual

The base-plane calibration is successful if the normal vector of the
estimated base plane is at most 10 degrees offset to the camera's line
of sight. If the base-plane calibration is successful, it will be
stored persistently on the

rc_visard

 until it is removed or a new base-plane calibration is performed.

Note: To avoid privacy issues, the image of the persistently stored
  base- plane calibration will appear blurred after rebooting the

  rc_visard

  .

In scenarios where the base plane is not accessible for calibration, a
plane parallel to the base-plane can be calibrated. Then an "offset"
parameter can be used to shift the estimated plane onto the actual
base plane where the objects are placed. The "offset" parameter gives
the distance in meters by which the estimated plane is shifted towards
the camera.

In the REST-API, a plane is defined by a "normal" and a "distance".
"normal" is a normalized 3-vector, specifying the normal of the plane.
The normal points away from the camera. "distance" represents the
distance of the plane from the camera along the normal. Normal and
distance can also be interpreted as a, b, c, and d components of the
plane equation, respectively:

   ax + by + cz + d = 0

AprilTag based base-plane calibration

AprilTag detection (ref.

TagDetect

) is used to find AprilTags in the scene and fit a plane through them.
At least three AprilTags must be placed on the base plane so that they
are visible in the left and right camera images. The tags should be
placed such that they are spanning a triangle that is as large as
possible. The larger the triangle, the more accurate is the resulting
base-plane estimate. Use this method if the base plane is untextured
and no external random dot projector is available. This calibration
mode is available via the

REST-API interface

 and the

rc_visard

 Web GUI.

Stereo based base-plane calibration

The 3D point cloud computed by the stereo matching component is used
to fit a plane through its 3D points. Therefore, the region of
interest (ROI) for this method must be set such that only the relevant
base plane is included. The "plane_preference" parameter allows to
select whether the plane closest to or farthest from the camera should
be used as base plane. Selecting the closest plane can be used in
scenarios where the base plane is completely occluded by objects or
not accessible for calibration. Use this method if the base plane is
well textured or you can make use of a random dot projector to project
texture on the base plane. This calibration mode is available via the

REST-API interface

 and the

rc_visard

 Web GUI.

Manual base-plane calibration

The base plane can be set manually if its parameters are known, e.g.
from previous calibrations. This calibration mode is only available
via the

REST-API interface

 and not the

rc_visard

 Web GUI.

Setting a region of interest

If objects are to be detected only in part of the camera’s field of
view, a region of interest (ROI) can be set accordingly. This ROI is
defined as a rectangular part of the left camera image, and can be set
via the

REST-API interface

 or the

rc_visard

 Web GUI. The Web GUI offers an easy-to-use selection tool. Up to 50
ROIs can be set and stored persistently on the

rc_visard

. Each ROI must have a unique name to address a specific ROI in the
base-plane calibration or object detection process.

In the REST-API, a 2D ROI is defined by the following values:

id: Unique name of the region of interest

offset_x, offset_y: offset in pixels along the x-axis and y-axis from
the top-left corner of the image, respectively

width, height: width and height in pixels

Detection of objects

Objects can only be detected after a successful base-plane
calibration. It must be ensured that the position and orientation of
the base plane does not change before the detection of objects.
Otherwise, the base-plane calibration must be renewed.

For triggering the object detection, in general, the following
information must be provided to the SilhouetteMatch component:

The template of the object to be detected in the scene.

The coordinate frame in which the poses of the detected objects shall
be returned (ref. Hand-eye calibration, Section \ref{silhouettematch
:sect-silhouettematch-hand-eye-calib}).

Optionally, further information can be given to the SilhouetteMatch
component:

An offset in case the objects are lying not on the base plane but on a
plane parallel to it. The offset is the distance between both planes
given in the direction towards the camera. If omitted, an offset of 0
is assumed.

The region of interest in which the objects should be detected. If
omitted, objects are matched in the whole image.

The current robot pose in case the chosen coordinate frame for the
poses is external and the camera is mounted on the robot.

On the Web GUI the detection can be tested in the "Try Out" section of
the SilhouetteMatch component's tab. The result is visualized as shown
in

Fig. 57

.


The right image shows the calibrated base plane in blue and the
template to be matched in green. The template is warped to the size
and tilt matching objects on the calibrated base plane would have.

The left image shows the detection result. The shaded blue area on the
left is the region of the left camera image which does not overlap
with the right image, and in which no objects can be detected. The
chosen region of interest is shown as bold petrol rectangle. The
detected edges in the image are shown in light blue and the matches
with the template are shown in green. The red circles are the origins
of the detected objects as defined in the template. The poses of the
object origins in the chosen coordinate frame are returned as results.
In case the objects are rotationally symmetric, all returned poses
will have the same orientation. For rotationally non-symmetric
objects, the orientation of the detected objects is aligned with the
normal of the base plane.

The detection results and runtimes are affected by several run-time
parameters which are listed and explained further down. Improper
parameters can lead to time-outs of the SilhouetteMatch component's
detection process.

Interaction with other components

Internally, the SilhouetteMatch component depends on, and interacts
with other on-board components as listed below.

Note: All changes and configuration updates to these components will
  affect the performance of the SilhouetteMatch component.

Stereo camera and stereo matching

The SilhouetteMatch component makes internally use of the rectified
images from the

Stereo camera

 component ("rc_stereocamera"). Thus, the exposure time should be set
properly to achieve the optimal performance of the component.

For base-plane calibration in stereo mode the disparity images from
the

Stereo matching

 component ("rc_stereomatching") are used. Apart from that, the
stereo-matching component should not be run in parallel to the
SilhouetteMatch component, because the detection runtime increases.

For best results it is recommended to enable

smoothing

  for

Stereo matching

.

IO and Projector Control

In case the

rc_visard

 is used in conjunction with an external random dot projector and the

IO and Projector Control

 component ("rc_iocontrol"), the projector should be used for the
stereo-based base-plane calibration.

The projected pattern must not be visible in the left and right camera
images during object detection as it interferes with the matching
process. Therefore, it must either be switched off or operated in
"ExposureAlternateActive" mode.

Hand-eye calibration

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the SilhouetteMatch
component can automatically provide poses in the robot coordinate
frame. For the SilhouetteMatch node's

Services

, the frame of the input and output poses and plane coordinates can be
controlled with the "pose_frame" argument.

Two different "pose_frame" values can be chosen:

Camera frame (camera). All poses and plane coordinates provided to and
by the component are in the camera frame.

External frame (external). All poses and plane coordinates provided to
and by the component are in the external frame, configured by the user
during the hand-eye calibration process. The component relies on the
on-board Hand-eye calibration component\:(Section
\ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration}) to retrieve the
camera mounting (static or robot mounted) and the hand-eye
transformation.

All "pose_frame" values that are not "camera" or "external" are
rejected.

Note: If no hand-eye calibration is available, all "pose_frame"
  values should be set to "camera".

Note: If the hand-eye calibration has changed after base-plane
  calibration, the base-plane calibration will be marked as invalid
  and must be renewed.

Depending on the value of "pose_frame", it is necessary to
additionally provide the current robot pose ("robot_pose") to the
SilhouetteMatch component:

If pose_frame is set to external, providing the robot pose is
obligatory.

If pose_frame is set to camera, providing the robot pose is optional.

If the current robot pose is provided during calibration, it is stored
persistently on the

rc_visard

. If the updated robot pose is later provided during
"get_base_plane_calibration" or "detect_object" as well, the base-
plane calibration will be transformed automatically to this new robot
pose. This enables the user to change the robot pose (and thus camera
position) between base-plane calibration and object detection.

Note: Object detection can only be performed if the limit of 10
  degrees angle offset between the base plane normal and the camera's
  line of sight is not exceeded.

. The user can explore and configure the "rc_silhouettematch"
component's run-time parameters, e.g. for development and testing,
using the Web GUI or the

REST-API interface

.

Parameter overview

This component offers the following run-time parameters:

The rc_silhouettematch component's run-time parameters
Name  Type  Min  Max  Default  Description  edge_sensitivity  float64
0.1  1.0  0.6  sensitivity of the edge detector  match_max_distance
float64  0.0  10.0  2.5  maximum allowed distance in pixels between
the template and the detected edges in the image  match_percentile

max_number_of_detected_objects  int32  1  20  10  maximum number of
detected objects  quality  string  -  -  High  H(igh), M(edium), or
L(ow)

Description of run-time parameters

Each run-time parameter is represented by a row on the Web GUI's
SilhouetteMatch Module tab. The name in the Web GUI is given in
brackets behind the parameter name and the parameters are listed in
the order they appear in the Web GUI:

"quality" (
Quality

)
   Object detection can be performed on images with different
   resolutions: high (1280 x 960), medium (640 x 480) and low (320 x
   240). The lower the resolution, the lower the detection time, but
   the fewer details of the objects are visible.

"max_number_of_detected_objects" (
Maximum Object Number

)
   This parameter gives the maximum number of objects to detect in the
   scene. If more than the given number of objects can be detected in
   the scene, only the objects with the highest matching results are
   returned.

"match_max_distance" (
Maximum Matching Distance

)
   This parameter gives the maximum allowed pixel distance of an image
   edge pixel from the object edge pixel in the template to be still
   considered as matching. If the object is not perfectly represented
   in the template, it might not be detected when this parameter is
   low. High values, however, might lead to false detections in case
   of a cluttered scene or the presence of similar objects, and also
   increase runtime.

"match_percentile" (
Matching Percentile

)
   This parameter indicates how strict the matching process should be.
   The matching percentile is the ratio of template pixels that must
   be within the Maximum Matching Distance to successfully match the
   template. The higher this number, the more accurate the match must
   be to be considered as valid.

"edge_sensitivity" (
Edge Sensitivity

)
   This parameter influences how many edges are detected in the camera
   images. The higher this number, the more edges are found in the
   intensity image. That means, for lower numbers, only the most
   significant edges are considered for template matching. A large
   number of edges in the image might increase the detection time.

Status values

This component reports the following status values:

The rc_silhouettematch component's status values      Name
Description  calibrate_service_time  Processing time of the base-plane
calibration, including data acquisition time  data_acquisition_time
Time in seconds required by the last active service to acquire images
detect_service_time  Processing time of the object dection, including
data acquisition time  last_timestamp_processed  The timestamp of the
last processed dataset

save_parameters

   This service saves the currently set parameters persistently.
   Thereby, the same parameters will still apply after a reboot of the

   rc_visard

   . The node parameters are not persistent over firmware updates and
   rollbacks.

   This service has no arguments.

   The definition for the response with corresponding datatypes is:

      {
        "return_code": {
          "message": "string",
          "value": "int16"
        }
      }

reset_defaults

   This service resets all parameters of the component to its default
   values, as listed in above table. The reset does not apply to
   regions of interest and base-plane calibration.

   This service has no arguments.

   The definition for the response with corresponding datatypes is:

      {
        "return_code": {
          "message": "string",
          "value": "int16"
        }
      }
