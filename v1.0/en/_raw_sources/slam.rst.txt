The SLAM module is part of the sensor dynamics component. When the |rc_visard|
moves through the world, its pose estimate slowly accumulates errors over time.
The SLAM module can correct these pose errors by recognizing previously visited
places.

The acronym SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. The
SLAM module creates a map consisting of the image features used in visual
odometry. The map is later used to correct accumulated pose errors. This is
most apparent in applications where the robot returns to a previously visited
place after covering a large distance (this is called a "loop closure").
In this case, the robot can redetect image features that are already stored
in its map and can use this information to correct the pose estimate.  When
closing a loop, not only the current pose, but also the past pose
estimates (the trajectory of the |rc_visard|), are corrected.
Continuous trajectory correction leads to a more
accurate map. On the other hand, the accuracy of the full trajectory is
important when it is used to build an integrated world model, e.g., by
projecting the obtained 3D point clouds obtained
(see :ref:`sect-point-clouds`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-point-clouds}`)
into a common coordinate frame. The full trajectory can be
requested from the SLAM module for this purpose.

The SLAM module will be optionally available for the |rc_visard| and will run on board
the sensor. If a SLAM license is stored on the |rc_visard|, then
the SLAM module is shown as *Available* on the :ref:`sect-web-gui`'s *Overview* tab,
and it can be switched on and off on the same page.

   |TODO| To be discussed: Does switching it on also reset the zero pose? Should we make the switch from VINS-only to SLAM and back impossible, (i.e. only enable transitions OFF<->VINS-only and OFF<->SLAM

   |TODO| Finalize and describe what pose streams are available from the dynamics module or reference the respective section
