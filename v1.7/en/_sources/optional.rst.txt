.

The

rc_visard

's optional software consists of the following components:

SLAM (rc_slam, Section \ref{slam:sect-slam})  performs simultaneous
localization and mapping for correcting accumulated poses. The
rc_visard's covered trajectory is offered via the REST-API
interface\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api}).

IO and Projector Control (rc_iocontrol, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-
iocontrol})  provides control over the general purpose inputs and
outputs with special modes for controlling an external random dot
projector.

TagDetect (rc_april_tag_detect and rc_qr_code_detect, Section
\ref{tagdetect:sect-tag-detection})  allows the detection of AprilTags
and QR codes, as well as the estimation of their poses.

ItemPick and BoxPick (rc_itempick and rc_boxpick, Section
\ref{itempick:sect-itempick})  provides an out-of-the-box perception
solution for robotic pick-and-place applications of unknown objects or
boxes.
