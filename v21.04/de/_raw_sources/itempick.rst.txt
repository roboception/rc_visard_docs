ItemPick and BoxPick
====================

   single: bin picking
   single: grasp computation

.. index:: ! BoxPick

Introduction
------------

.. Short description and functionalities

The ItemPick and BoxPick modules are optional on-board modules of the |rc_xxx|
and require separate ItemPick or BoxPick :ref:`licenses<sect-updating-license>`
:latex:`(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased.

The modules provide out-of-the-box perception solutions for robotic pick-and-place
applications. ItemPick targets the detection of flat surfaces of unknown objects for picking
with a suction gripper. BoxPick detects rectangular surfaces and determines their position,
orientation and size for grasping. The interface of both modules is very similar. Therefore
both modules are described together in this chapter.

In addition, both modules offer:

- A dedicated page on the |rc_xxx| :ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
  for easy setup, configuration, testing, and application tuning.
- The definition of regions of interest to select relevant volumes in the scene 
  (see :ref:`sect-roi`:latex:`, Section \ref{roi:sect-roi}`).
- A load carrier detection functionality for bin-picking applications 
  (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier}`),
  to provide grasps for items inside a bin only.
- The definition of compartments inside a load carrier to provide grasps
  for specific volumes of the bin only.
- Support for static and robot-mounted cameras and
  optional integration with the :doc:`handeye_calibration`
  :latex:`(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})` module,
  to provide grasps in the user-configured external reference frame.
- A quality value associated to each suggested grasp and related to the flatness of the grasping surface.
- Sorting of grasps according to gravity and size so that items on top of a pile are grasped first.

.. Note::

  In this chapter, cluster and surface are used as synonyms and identify a set of
  points (or pixels) with defined geometrical properties.


.. _sect-itempick-detect-items:

Detection of items (BoxPick)
----------------------------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; item model

The BoxPick module supports the detection of multiple ``item_models`` of
``type`` ``RECTANGLE``.
Each item model is defined by its minimum and maximum size, with the
minimum dimensions strictly smaller than the maximum dimensions.
The dimensions should be given fairly accurately to avoid misdetections, 
while still considering a certain tolerance to account for possible production variations 
and measurement inaccuracies. 

Optionally, further information can be given to the BoxPick module:

- The ID of the load carrier which contains the items to be detected.
- A compartment inside the load carrier where to detect items.
- The ID of the region of interest where to search for the load carriers if a
  load carrier is set.
  Otherwise, the ID of the region of interest where to search for the items.
- The current robot pose in case the camera is mounted on the robot and 
  the chosen coordinate frame for the poses is ``external`` or the chosen 
  region of interest is defined in the external frame.

The detected ``item`` poses are given relative to the centers of the rectangles,
with the z axis pointing towards the camera.
Each detected item includes a ``uuid`` (Universally Unique Identifier) and the
``timestamp`` of the oldest image that was used to detect it.

.. _sect-itempick-compute-grasps:

Computation of grasps
---------------------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; grasp
   single: ItemPick; grasp

The ItemPick and BoxPick modules offer a service for computing grasps for
suction grippers. The gripper is defined by its suction surface length and width.

The ItemPick module identifies flat surfaces in the scene and supports
flexible and/or deformable items. The ``type`` of these ``item_models`` is
called ``UNKNOWN`` since they don't need to have a standard geometrical shape.
Optionally, the user can also specify the minimum and maximum size of the item.

For BoxPick, the grasps are computed on the detected rectangular ``items``
(see :ref:`sect-itempick-detect-items`:latex:`, Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-detect-items}`).

Optionally, further information can be given to the modules in a grasp
computation request:

- The ID of the load carrier which contains the items to be grasped.
- A compartment inside the load carrier where to compute grasps 
  (see :ref:`sect-loadcarrier-compartment`:latex:`, Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-loadcarrier-compartment}`).
- The ID of the 3D region of interest where to search for the load carriers if a
  load carrier is set.
  Otherwise, the ID of the 3D region of interest where to compute grasps.
- Collision detection information: The ID of the gripper to enable collision checking and optionally
  a pre-grasp offset to define a pre-grasp position.
  Details on collision
  checking are given below in :ref:`sect-itempick-collision-check-dep`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-collision-check-dep})`.


A grasp provided by the ItemPick and BoxPick modules represents the recommended
pose of the TCP (Tool Center Point) of the suction gripper.
The grasp ``type`` is always set to ``SUCTION``.
The computed grasp pose is the center of the biggest ellipse that can be inscribed in
each surface.
The grasp orientation is a right-handed coordinate system and is defined such
that its z axis is normal to the surface pointing inside the object at the grasp position and
its x axis is directed along the maximum elongation of the ellipse.

.. _fig-itempick-grasp-surface:
.. figure:: images/itempick_grasp_surface.png
   :width: 300 px
   :align: center

   Illustration of suction grasp with coordinate system and ellipse representing
   the maximum suction surface.

Each grasp includes the dimensions of the maximum suction surface available,
modelled as an ellipse of axes ``max_suction_surface_length`` and
``max_suction_surface_width``. The user is enabled to filter grasps by specifying
the minimum suction surface required by the suction device in use.

In the BoxPick module, the grasp position corresponds to the center of the detected
rectangle and the dimensions of the maximum suction surface available matches the estimated
rectangle dimensions. Detected rectangles with missing data or occlusions by other objects for more
than 15% of their surface do not get an associated grasp.

Each grasp also includes a ``quality`` value, which gives an
indication of the flatness of the grasping surface.
The ``quality`` value varies between 0 and 1, where higher numbers correspond to a
flatter reconstructed surface.

.. In case of multi-cup suction devices, the suction surface
.. is expected to cover all suction elements.

The grasp definition is complemented by a ``uuid`` (Universally Unique Identifier)
and the ``timestamp`` of the oldest image that was used to compute the grasp.

Grasps sorting is performed based on a combination of

- the distance from the camera along the gravity direction, and
- the size of the item to grasp.

Grasp points on top of a pile and corresponding to larger items are grasped first.

.. _sect-itempick-dependencies:

Interaction with other modules
------------------------------

Internally, the ItemPick and BoxPick modules depend on, and interact with other on-board
modules as listed below.

.. Note::
  All changes and configuration updates to these modules will affect
  the performance of the ItemPick and BoxPick modules.

.. For each load carrier detection and grasp computation, the ItemPick module
.. acquires datasets of synchronized images and estimates the gravity vector.
.. The data acquisition step normally takes between 500 ms and 600 ms
.. with "High" depth image quality.

.. _sect-itempick-stereo-camera-matching:

Stereo camera and Stereo matching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ItemPick and BoxPick modules make internally use of the following data:

- Rectified images from the :doc:`stereo_camera` module
  (``rc_stereocamera``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-stereo-camera}`);

- Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`stereo_matching` module
  (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`).

All processed images are guaranteed to be captured after the module trigger time.

.. _sect-itempick-dynamics:

Estimation of gravity vector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each load carrier detection and grasp computation, the modules
estimate the gravity vector by subscribing to the |rc_visard|'s IMU data stream.

.. Note::
   The gravity vector is estimated from linear acceleration readings from the on-board IMU.
   For this reason, the ItemPick and BoxPick modules require the |rc_visard| to remain
   still while the gravity vector is being estimated.

.. _sect-itempick-iocontrol-dep:

IO and Projector Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the |rc_xxx| is used in conjunction with an external random dot projector and
the :doc:`iocontrol` module (``rc_iocontrol``:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol}`),
it is recommended to connect the projector to GPIO Out 1 and set
the stereo-camera module's acquisition mode to ``SingleFrameOut1``
(see :ref:`Stereo matching parameters<sect-disp-image-parameters>`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-image-parameters}`), so that
on each image acquisition trigger an image with and without projector pattern is acquired.

Alternatively, the output mode for the GPIO output in use should be set to ``ExposureAlternateActive``
(see :ref:`sect-iocontrol-params`:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol-params}`).

In either case,
the *Auto Exposure Mode* ``exp_auto_mode`` should be set to ``AdaptiveOut1`` to optimize the exposure
of both images (see :ref:`Stereo camera parameters<sect-cam-params>`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`).

.. _sect-itempick-hand-eye-dep:

Hand-eye calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the ItemPick and BoxPick modules
can automatically provide poses in the robot coordinate frame.
For the ItemPick and BoxPick nodes' :ref:`sect-itempick-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-services})`, the frame of the
output poses can be controlled with the ``pose_frame`` argument.

Two different ``pose_frame`` values can be chosen:

1. **Camera frame** (``camera``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the camera frame,
   and no prior knowledge about the pose of the camera in the environment is required.
   This means that the configured regions of interest and load carriers move with the camera.
   It is the user's responsibility to update the configured poses
   if the camera frame moves (e.g. with a robot-mounted camera).

2. **External frame** (``external``).
   All poses provided by the modules are in the external frame,
   configured by the user during the hand-eye calibration process.
   The module relies on the on-board 
   :doc:`Hand-eye calibration module<handeye_calibration>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})`
   to retrieve the sensor mounting (static or robot mounted) and
   the hand-eye transformation.
   If the mounting is static, no further information is needed.
   If the sensor is robot-mounted, the ``robot_pose`` is required
   to transform poses to and from the ``external`` frame.

.. Note::
   If no hand-eye calibration is available, all ``pose_frame`` values should be set to ``camera``.

All ``pose_frame`` values that are not ``camera`` or ``external`` are rejected.


.. _sect-itempick-collision-check-dep:

CollisionCheck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collision checking can be easily enabled for
grasp computation of the ItemPick and BoxPick modules by passing the ID of the used gripper and
optionally a pre-grasp offset to the 
``compute_grasps`` service call. The gripper has to be
defined in the CollisionCheck module
(see :ref:`sect-collisioncheck-gripper`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-gripper})`)
and details about collision checking are given in :ref:`sect-collision-check-other-modules`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collision-check-other-modules})`.

If collision checking is enabled, only grasps which are collision free will be returned. 
However, the visualization images on the *ItemPick* or *BoxPick*
tab of the |webgui| also show colliding grasp points as black ellipses.

The CollisionCheck module's run-time parameters affect the collision detection as described in
:ref:`CollisionCheck Parameters<sect-collisioncheck-parameters>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-parameters})`.

.. _sect-itempick-parameters:

.. _expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps-boxpick:

``compute_grasps`` (for BoxPick)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Triggers the detection of rectangles and the computation of grasping poses
   for the detected rectangles as described in 
   :ref:`sect-itempick-compute-grasps`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-compute-grasps})`.

   This service can be called as follows.

   .. code-block:: bash

       ``item_models``: list of rectangles with minimum and maximum size, with the
       minimum dimensions strictly smaller than the maximum dimensions.
       The dimensions should be given fairly accurately to avoid misdetections, 
       while still considering a certain tolerance to account for possible production variations 
       and measurement inaccuracies. 

       ``suction_surface_length``: length of the suction device grasping surface.

       ``suction_surface_width``: width of the suction device grasping surface.

.. _expl-itempick-srv-save-params:

``save_parameters``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This service saves the currently set parameters persistently.
   Thereby, the same parameters will still apply after a reboot of
   the |rc_xxx|.
   The node parameters are not persistent over firmware updates and rollbacks.

   This service can be called as follows.

   .. code-block:: bash

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/<rc_itempick|rc_boxpick>/services/save_parameters

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_itempick_save_parameters.txt

.. _expl-itempick-srv-reset-params:

``reset_defaults``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This service resets all parameters of the module to its default values,
   as listed in above table.
   The reset does not apply to regions of interest and load carriers.

   This service can be called as follows.

   .. code-block:: bash

      PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/<rc_itempick|rc_boxpick>/services/save_parameters
