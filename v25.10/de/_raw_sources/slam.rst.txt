The SLAM module is an optional on-board module of the |rc_visard| and requires a separate SLAM
:ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased. 
If a SLAM license is stored on the |rc_visard|, then
the SLAM module is shown as *Available* on the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`'s
*License* section of the *System* page.

The SLAM module is part of the sensor dynamics module. It provides
additional accuracy for the pose estimate of the stereo INS.  When the |rc_visard| moves through
the world, the pose estimate slowly accumulates errors over time. The SLAM
module can correct these pose errors by recognizing previously visited places.

The acronym SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. The
SLAM module creates a map consisting of the image features as used in the visual
odometry module. The map is later used to correct accumulated pose errors. This is
most apparent in applications where, e.g., a robot returns to a previously visited
place after covering a large distance (this is called a *loop closure*).
In this case, the robot can re-detect image features that are already stored
in its map and can use this information to correct the drift in the pose estimate that
accumulated since the last visit.

When closing a loop, not only the current pose, but also the past pose
estimates (the trajectory of the |rc_visard|), are corrected.  Continuous
trajectory correction leads to a more accurate map. On the other hand, the
accuracy of the full trajectory is important when it is used to build an
integrated world model, e.g., by projecting the 3D point clouds
obtained (see :ref:`sect-point-clouds`:latex:`, Section
\ref{stereo_general:sect-point-clouds}`) into a common coordinate frame. The
full trajectory can be requested from the SLAM module for this purpose.

Usage
-----

The SLAM module can be activated at any time, either via the rc_dynamics
interface (see the documentation of the respective
:ref:`sect-dynamics-services`:latex:`, Section \ref{dynamics:sect-dynamics-services}`)
or from the *Dynamics* page of the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`.

The pose estimate of the SLAM module will be initialized with the current
estimate of the stereo INS - and thus the origin will be where the stereo INS
was started.

Since the SLAM module builds on the motion estimates of the stereo INS module,
the latter will automatically be started up if it is not yet running when SLAM is started.

When the SLAM module is running, the corrected pose estimates will be available via the
datastreams :ref:`pose<sect-datastream-pose>`, :ref:`pose_rt<sect-datastream-pose-rt>`,
and :ref:`dynamics<sect-datastream-dynamics>` of the rc_dynamics module.

The full trajectory is available through the service ``get_trajectory``,
see :ref:`sect-slam-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{slam:sect-slam-services})`
below for details.

To store the feature map on the |rc-visard|, the SLAM module provides the service
``save_map``, which can be used only during runtime (state "RUNNING") or after stopping
(state "HALTED"). 

A stored map can be loaded before startup using the service ``load_map``,
which is only applicable in state "IDLE" (use the ``reset`` service to go back to "IDLE"
when SLAM is in state "HALTED"). Note that mistaken localization at (visually) similar places may happen more
easily when initially localizing in a loaded map than when localizing during continuous operation.
Choosing a starting point with a unique visual appearance avoids this problem.
The SLAM module will therefore assume that the |rc-visard| is started in the rough vicinity
(a few meters) of the origin of the map. The origin of the map is where the Stereo-INS
module was started when the map was recorded.


Memory limitations
------------------

In contrast to the other software modules running on the |rc_visard|, the
SLAM module needs to accumulate data over time, e.g., motion measurements and
image features.  Further, the optimization of the trajectory requires
substantial amounts of memory, particularly when closing large loops.
Therefore the memory requirements of the SLAM module increase over time.

Given the memory limitations of the hardware, the SLAM module needs to reduce
its own memory footprint when running continuously. When the available memory
runs low, the SLAM module will fix parts of the trajectory, i.e. no further
optimization will be done on these parts.
A minimum of 10 minutes of the trajectory will be kept unfixed at all times.

When the available memory runs low despite the above measures, two options
are available. The first option is that the SLAM module automatically goes to
the HALTED state, where it stops processing, but the trajectory (up to the
stopping time) is still available. This is the default behavior.

The second option is to keep running until the memory is exhausted. In that
case, the SLAM module will be restarted. If the ``autorecovery`` parameter is set
to true, the SLAM module will recover its previous position and resume
mapping. Otherwise it will go to FATAL state, requiring to be restarted via
the rc_dynamics interface (see :ref:`sect-dynamics-services`:latex:`, Section \ref{dynamics:sect-dynamics-services}`).

The operation time until the memory limit is reached is strongly dependent
on the trajectory of the sensor.

.. Warning:: Because of the memory limitations, it is not recommended to run
  SLAM at the same time as :doc:`stereo_matching` in full resolution, because
  the memory available to SLAM will be greatly reduced. In the worst case, a
  long running SLAM process may even be forcefully reset, when full-resolution
  stereo matching is turned on.

.. _sect-slam-services:

Services
--------

.. NOTE:: Activation and deactivation of the SLAM module is done via the service interface of rc_dynamics
   (see :ref:`sect-dynamics-services`:latex:`, Section \ref{dynamics:sect-dynamics-services}`).

Each service response (except for the ``reset`` service) contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.

The SLAM module offers the following services.

.. _expl-slam-srv-get-trajectory:

``get_trajectory``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   returns the trajectory. 

   .. toggle-header::
      :header: **Details**
            
      This service can be called as follows.
      
      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: **API version 2**

            .. code-block:: bash

               PUT http://<host>/api/v2/pipelines/0/nodes/rc_slam/services/get_trajectory

         .. tab:: **API version 1 (deprecated)**
            
            .. code-block:: bash

               PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_slam/services/get_trajectory

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: **Request**

            The service arguments
            allow to select a subsection of the trajectory by defining a ``start_time`` and
            an ``end_time``.  Both are optional, i.e., they could be left empty or filled with zero values,
            which results in the subsection to include the trajectory from the very beginning,
            or to the very end, respectively, or both. If not empty or zero, they can be defined either as absolute
            timestamps or to be relative to the trajectory (``start_time_relative``  and ``end_time_relative`` flags).
            If defined to be relative, the values' signs indicate to which point in time they relate to:
            Positive values define an offset to the start time of the trajectory; negative values are interpreted as
            an offset from the end time of the trajectory. The below diagram illustrates three
            examples for the relative parameterization.

            .. figure:: images/rc_slam_get_trajectory_examples.*
               :width: 90 %
               :align: center

               Examples for combinations of relative start and end times for the ``get_trajectory`` service.
               All combinations shown select the same subset of the trajectory.

            .. NOTE:: A relative ``start_time`` of zero will select everything from the start of the trajectory,
                        whereas a relative ``end_time`` of zero will select everything to the end of the trajectory.
                        Absolute zero values effectively do the same, so one can set all values zero to get the full trajectory.


            .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_slam_get_trajectory_request.txt

         .. tab:: **Response**

            The field ``producer`` indicates where the trajectory data comes from and is always ``slam``.

            The field ``return_code`` holds possible warnings or error codes and messages.
            The following table contains a list of possible ``return_code`` values:

            .. tabularcolumns:: |c|L|
            .. csv-table::
                  :header: Code, Description

                  "0",   "Success"
                  "-1",  "An invalid argument was provided (e.g., an invalid time range)"
                  "101", "Trajectory is empty, because there is no data in the given time range"
                  "102", "Trajectory is empty, because there is no data at all (e.g., when SLAM is IDLE)"
