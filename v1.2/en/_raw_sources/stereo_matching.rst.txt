Stereo matching
===============

.. index::
   single: disparity
   single: disparity image

The stereo matching component uses the rectified stereo-image pair and computes
disparity, error, and confidence images.

.. _sect-disparity-images:

Computing disparity images
--------------------------

After rectification, the left and right images have the nice property that an
object point is projected onto the same pixel row in both images. That point's pixel
column in the right image is always lower than or equal
to the same point's pixel column in the left image. The term disparity
signifies the difference between the pixel columns in the right and left images
and expresses the depth or distance of the object point from the |rc_visard|. The
disparity image stores the disparity values of all pixels in the left camera
image.

The larger the disparity, the closer the object point. A disparity of 0
means that the projections of the object point are in the same image column
and the object point is at infinite distance. Often, there are pixels for which disparity
cannot be determined. This is the case for occlusions that appear on the
left sides of objects, because these areas are not seen from the right camera.
Furthermore, disparity cannot be determined for textureless areas. Pixels
for which the disparity cannot be determined are marked as invalid with the
special disparity value of 0. To distinguish between invalid disparity
measurements and disparity measurements of 0 for objects that are infinitely
far away, the disparity value for the latter is set to the smallest possible
disparity value above 0.

.. index:: ! SGM
   see: Semi-Global Matching; SGM

To compute disparity values, the stereo matching algorithm has to find
corresponding object points in the left and right camera images. These are points
that represent the same object point in the scene. For stereo matching, the |rc_visard| uses
|sgm|, which offers brief run times and
a great accuracy, especially at object borders, fine structures, and in weakly textured areas.

.. index::
   single: texture

A key requirement for any stereo matching method is the presence of texture in the
image, i.e., image-intensity changes due to patterns or surface
structure within the scene. In completely untextured regions such as a flat white
wall without any structure, disparity values can either not be computed or the
results are erroneous or have low confidence (see
:ref:`sect-confidence-error`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-confidence-error}`). The texture in the scene should not be an
artificial, repetitive pattern, since those structures may lead to ambiguities and hence to  wrong disparity measurements.

If the |rc_visard| has to work in
untextured environments, then a static artificial texture can be projected
onto the scene using an external pattern projector. This pattern should be random-like
and not contain repetitive structures.

.. _sect-point-clouds:

Computing depth images and point clouds
---------------------------------------

.. index:: ! depth image
   single: depth image
   pair: 3D coordinates; disparity image

The following equations show how to compute an object point's actual 3D coordinates :math:`P_x, P_y, P_z` in the
:ref:`sensor coordinate frame<sect-coordinate-frames>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{hardware_spec:sect-coordinate-frames})`
from the disparity image's pixel coordinates :math:`p_{x}, p_{y}`
and the disparity value :math:`d` in pixels:

.. math::
  :label: reconstruction

  P_x&=\frac{p_x \cdot t}{d}\\
  P_y&=\frac{p_y \cdot t}{d}\\
  P_z&=\frac{f \cdot t}{d},

where :math:`f` is the focal length after rectification in pixels and :math:`t`
is the stereo baseline in meters, which was determined during calibration. These values
are also transferred over the GenICam interface (see
:ref:`sect-custom-genicam-params`:latex:`, \:Section \ref{gigevision:sect-custom-genicam-params}`).

.. note::  The |rc_visard| reports a focal length factor via its various
      interfaces. It relates to the image width
      for supporting different image resolutions. The focal length :math:`f`
      in pixels can be easily obtained by multiplying the focal length factor
      by the image width in pixels.

Please note that equations :eq:`reconstruction` assume that the coordinate frame is centered
in the middle of the image. The following figure shows the definition of the image coordinate
frame.

.. figure:: images/image_coordinates.png
   :width: 30 %
   :align: center

   The image coordinate frame's origin is defined to be at the image's center
   -- :math:`w` is the image width and :math:`h` is the image height.

The same equations, but with the corresponding GenICam parameters are given in
:ref:`sect-image-stream-conversions`:latex:`\\:(Section \ref{gigevision:sect-image-stream-conversions})`.

.. index::
   single: 3D modeling
   single: point cloud
   single: 3D coordinates

The set of all object points computed from the disparity image gives the point
cloud, which can be used for 3D modeling applications. The disparity image is
converted into a depth image by replacing
the disparity value in each pixel with the value of :math:`P_z`.

.. ifconfig:: not kuka

   .. Note:: Roboception provides software and examples for receiving disparity images from
      the |rc_visard| via GigE Vision and computing depth images and point clouds. See
      http://www.roboception.com/download.

.. _sect-confidence-error:

Confidence and error images
---------------------------

.. index:: ! confidence, !error
   single: disparity error

For each disparity image, the |rc_visard| provides an error image and a confidence image,
which give uncertainty measures for each disparity value. These images
have the same resolution and the same frame rate as the disparity image. The
error image contains the disparity error :math:`d_{eps}` in pixels corresponding
to the disparity value at the same image coordinates in the disparity image.
The confidence image contains the corresponding confidence value :math:`c`
between 0 and 1. The confidence is defined as the probability of the true
disparity value being within the interval of three times the error around the
measured disparity :math:`d`, i.e., :math:`[d-3d_{eps}, d+3d_{eps}]`.
Thus, the disparity image with error and confidence values can be used in
applications requiring probabilistic inference. The confidence and error values
corresponding to an invalid disparity measurement will be 0.

The disparity error :math:`d_{eps}` (in pixels) can be converted to a depth error :math:`z_{eps}`
(in meters) using the focal length :math:`f` (in pixels), the baseline :math:`t` (in meters), and the disparity
value :math:`d` (in pixels) of the same pixel in the disparity image:

.. math::
   z_{eps}=\frac{d_{eps}\cdot f\cdot t}{d^2}.
   :label: eq-deptherror

Combining equations :eq:`reconstruction` and :eq:`eq-deptherror` allows the
depth error to be related to the depth:

.. math::
   z_{eps}=\frac{d_{eps}\cdot{P_z}^2}{f\cdot t}.

With the focal length and baselines of both |rc_visard| models and the typical disparity
error :math:`d_{eps}` of 0.5 pixels, the depth error can be visualized as shown below.

.. figure:: _plot/reconstruction_error.png
   :width: 60 %

.. index::
   pair: timestamp; image

The |rc_visard| provides time-stamped disparity, error, and confidence images over the
GenICam interface (see :ref:`sect-provided-image-streams`:latex:`, \:Section \ref{gigevision:sect-provided-image-streams}`).
Live streams of the images are provided with reduced quality in the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`.

Parameters
----------

.. index::
   pair: parameters; disparity image
   pair: disparity image; Web GUI
   pair: depth image; Web GUI

The stereo matching component is called ``rc_stereomatching`` in the |rest-api| and it is represented by the
*Depth Image* tab in the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`.
The user can change the stereo matching parameters there, or use the |rest-api|
(:ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`, Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api}`) or GigE Vision
(:ref:`sect-genicam`:latex:`, Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam}`).

Parameter overview
..................

.. include:: _gen/nodes/params/rc_stereomatching.txt

Since SGM stereo matching and post processing run in parallel, the overall processing time for
this component is the maximum of ``time_matching`` and ``time_postprocessing``. This time is
shown in the |webgui| below the image preview as *Processing Time (s)*.

Description of run-time parameters
..................................

Each run-time parameter is represented by a row on the |webgui|'s *Depth Image* tab. The name in the
|webgui| is given in brackets behind the parameter name and the parameters are listed in the order
they appear in the |webgui|:

   The |webgui|'s *Depth Image* tab

.. index::
   pair: quality; disparity image
   pair: disparity image; frame rate

.. _expl-depth-quality:

``quality`` (*Quality*)
    Disparity images can be computed in three different resolutions:
    high (640 x 480), medium (320 x 240) and low (214 x 160). The lower the resolution,
    the higher the frame rate of the disparity image. A 25 Hz frame rate can be achieved
    only at the lowest resolution. Additionally, *static* can be chosen, which means
    high-resolution processing, limited to a maximal frame rate of 3 Hz and accumulation
    of all intermediate input images. The accumulation reduces noise, but is only suitable
    if the scene does not change. Please note that the frame
    rate of the disparity, confidence, and error images will always be less than or equal to
    the camera frame rate.

    .. _expl-depth-disp-range:

    .. index::
       single: disparity range

``disprange`` (*Disparity Range*)
    The disparity range always start at 0 and goes up to the maximum disparity value a pixel
    in the disparity image can have. Increasing the disparity range results in a smaller
    minimum distance that can be measured, because larger disparity values mean smaller
    distances. The disparity range is given in pixels and can be set to a value between
    32 pixels and 512 pixels. Since a larger disparity range also means a larger search
    area for the matching pixel in the right rectified image, the processing time
    increases with a larger disparity range and the frame rate decreases. The
    disparity range's value is related to the high-resolution disparity image with
    640 x 480 pixels and does not have to be scaled when a lower resolution is chosen.
    Thus, the chosen disparity range gives the same minimum distance for every
    image-quality option.

    .. _expl-depth-fill:

    .. index::
       single: fill-in

``fill`` (*Fill-in*)
   This option is used to fill holes in the disparity image by interpolating a plane.
   Only holes smaller than the segmentation size (see below) are selected
   for interpolation. The fill-in value is the maximum allowed disparity deviation
   of any of the hole's border pixels from the interpolation plane. Only if all
   of its border pixels deviate less than the fill-in value from the plane, a hole
   will be filled. Larger fill-in values decrease the number of holes, but the
   interpolated values can have larger errors. The confidence for the interpolated
   pixels is set to a low value of 0.5. Their error is set
   to the mean deviation of the hole border pixels from the interpolation plane. A value
   of 0 effectively switches hole filling off.

   .. _expl-depth-seg:

   .. index::
      single: segmentation

``seg`` (*Segmentation*)
   The segmentation parameter is used to set the minimum number of
   pixels that a connected disparity region in the disparity image must fill.
   Isolated regions that are smaller are set to invalid in the disparity image.
   This is useful for removing erroneous disparities. However, larger
   values may also remove real objects.

   .. _expl-depth-median:

   .. index::
      single: median

``median`` (*Median*)
   This value gives the window side length in pixels for the median filter,
   which smoothes the disparity image. Larger values lead to oversmoothing and cost
   more processing time. A window size of 1 effectively turns this filter off.

   .. _expl-depth-min-conf:

   .. index::
      single: minimum confidence
      pair: confidence; minimum

``minconf`` (*Minimum Confidence*)
   The minimum confidence can be set to filter potentially false disparity measurements.
   All pixels with less confidence than the chosen value are set to invalid
   in the disparity image.

   .. _expl-depth-max-depth-err:

   .. index::
      single: maximum depth error
      pair: depth error; maximum

``maxdeptherr`` (*Maximum Depth Error*)
   The maximum depth error is used to filter measurements
   that are too inaccurate. All pixels with a larger depth error than the chosen
   value are set to invalid in the disparity image. The maximum
   depth error is given in meters. The depth error generally grows quadratically
   with an object's distance from the sensor (see :ref:`sect-confidence-error`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-confidence-error}`).

   .. _expl-depth-min-depth:

   .. index::
      single: minimum distance

``mindepth`` (*Minimum Distance*)
   The minimum distance is the smallest distance from the sensor
   at which measurements should be possible. Larger values implicitly reduce the
   disparity range, which also reduces the computation time. The minimum distance
   is given in meters.

   .. _expl-depth-max-depth:

   .. index::
      single: maximum distance

``maxdepth`` (*Maximum Distance*)
   The maximum distance is the largest distance from the sensor
   at which measurements should be possible. Pixels with larger distance values are
   set to invalid in the disparity image. Setting this value to its maximum permits
   values up to infinity. The maximum distance is given in meters.


The same parameters are also available over the GenICam interface with slightly different names and partly with different data types
(see :ref:`sect-genicam`:latex:`, Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam}`).

Services
--------

The stereo matching component offers the following services for persisting and
restoring parameter settings.

``save_parameters``  (*Save*)
   With this service call, the stereo matching component's current parameter settings
   are persisted to the |rcvisard|. That is,
   these values are applied even after reboot.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_stereomatching_save_parameters.txt

``reset_defaults``  (*Reset*)
   Restores and applies the default values for this component's parameters
   ("factory reset").

   .. WARNING:: The user must be aware that calling this service causes the
      current parameter settings for the stereo matching component to be irrecoverably lost.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_stereomatching_reset_defaults.txt
