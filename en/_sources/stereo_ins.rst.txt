Stereo INS

The stereo-vision-aided Inertial Navigation System (

INS

) component is part of the sensor dynamics component. It combines
visual-odometry measurements with inertial measurement unit (

IMU

) data and provides robust, low latency, real-time state estimates at
a high rate. The IMU consists of three accelerometers and three
gyroscopes, which measure accelerations and turn rates in all three
dimensions. By fusing IMU and visual-odometry measurements, the state
estimate has the same frequency as the IMU (200 Hz) and is very robust
even under challenging lighting conditions and for fast motions.
