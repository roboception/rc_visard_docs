Stereo matching
===============

.. index::
   single: disparity
   single: disparity image

The stereo matching component uses the rectified stereo-image pair and computes
disparity, error, and confidence images.

.. _sect-disparity-images:

Computing disparity images
--------------------------

After rectification, an object point is guaranteed to be projected onto the same
pixel row in both left and right image. That point's pixel
column in the right image is always lower than or equal
to the same point's pixel column in the left image. The term disparity
signifies the difference between the pixel columns in the right and left images
and expresses the depth or distance of the object point from the camera. The
disparity image stores the disparity values of all pixels in the left camera
image.

The larger the disparity, the closer the object point. A disparity of 0
means that the projections of the object point are in the same image column
and the object point is at infinite distance. Often, there are pixels for which disparity
cannot be determined. This is the case for occlusions that appear on the
left sides of objects, because these areas are not seen from the right camera.
Furthermore, disparity cannot be determined for textureless areas. Pixels
for which the disparity cannot be determined are marked as invalid with the
special disparity value of 0. To distinguish between invalid disparity
measurements and disparity measurements of 0 for objects that are infinitely
far away, the disparity value for the latter is set to the smallest possible
disparity value above 0.

.. index:: ! SGM
   see: Semi-Global Matching; SGM

To compute disparity values, the stereo matching algorithm has to find
corresponding object points in the left and right camera images. These are points
that represent the same object point in the scene. For stereo matching, the |rc_xxx| uses
|sgm|, which offers quick run times and
great accuracy, especially at object borders, fine structures, and in weakly textured areas.

.. index::
   single: texture

A key requirement for any stereo matching method is the presence of texture in the
image, i.e., image-intensity changes due to patterns or surface
structure within the scene. In completely untextured regions such as a flat white
wall without any structure, disparity values can either not be computed or the
results are erroneous or have low confidence (see
:ref:`sect-confidence-error`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-confidence-error}`). The texture in the scene should not be an
artificial, repetitive pattern, since those structures may lead to ambiguities and hence to  wrong disparity measurements.

When working with poorly textured objects or in
untextured environments, a static artificial texture can be projected
onto the scene using an external pattern projector. This pattern should be random-like
and not contain repetitive structures. The |rc_xxx| provides the IOControl component
(see :ref:`sect-iocontrol`:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol}`) as
optional software module which can control a pattern projector connected to the |rc_visard|.

.. _sect-point-clouds:

Computing depth images and point clouds
---------------------------------------

.. index:: ! depth image
   single: depth image
   pair: 3D coordinates; disparity image

The following equations show how to compute an object point's actual 3D coordinates :math:`P_x, P_y, P_z` in the
camera coordinate frame
from the disparity image's pixel coordinates :math:`p_{x}, p_{y}`
and the disparity value :math:`d` in pixels:

.. math::
  :label: reconstruction

  P_x&=\frac{p_x \cdot t}{d}\\
  P_y&=\frac{p_y \cdot t}{d}\\
  P_z&=\frac{f \cdot t}{d},

where :math:`f` is the focal length after rectification in pixels and :math:`t`
is the stereo baseline in meters, which was determined during calibration. These values
are also transferred over the GenICam interface (see
:ref:`sect-custom-genicam-params`:latex:`, \:Section \ref{gigevision:sect-custom-genicam-params}`).

.. only:: rc_visard

   .. note:: The |rc_xxx|'s camera coordinate frame is defined as shown in
             :ref:`sect-coordinate-frames`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{hardware_spec:sect-coordinate-frames})`.

.. note::  The |rc_xxx| reports a focal length factor via its various
      interfaces. It relates to the image width
      for supporting different image resolutions. The focal length :math:`f`
      in pixels can be easily obtained by multiplying the focal length factor
      by the image width in pixels.

Please note that equations :eq:`reconstruction` assume that the coordinate
frame is centered in the principal point that is typically in the center of the image,
and :math:`p_{x}, p_{y}` refer to the middle of the pixel, i.e. by adding 0.5 to the
integer pixel coordinates. The following figure shows the definition of the image coordinate
frame.

.. figure:: images/image_coordinates.png
   :width: 30 %
   :align: center

   The image coordinate frame's origin is defined to be at the image center
   -- :math:`w` is the image width and :math:`h` is the image height.

The same equations, but with the corresponding GenICam parameters are given in
:ref:`sect-image-stream-conversions`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{gigevision:sect-image-stream-conversions})`.

.. index::
   single: 3D modeling
   single: point cloud
   single: 3D coordinates

The set of all object points computed from the disparity image gives the point
cloud, which can be used for 3D modeling applications. The disparity image is
converted into a depth image by replacing
the disparity value in each pixel with the value of :math:`P_z`.

.. Note:: |manufacturer| provides software and examples for receiving disparity images from
   the |rc_xxx| via GigE Vision and computing depth images and point clouds. See
   http://www.roboception.com/download.

.. _sect-confidence-error:

Confidence and error images
---------------------------

.. index:: ! confidence, !error
   single: disparity error

For each disparity image, additionally an error image and a confidence image are provided,
which give uncertainty measures for each disparity value. These images
have the same resolution and the same frame rate as the disparity image. The
error image contains the disparity error :math:`d_{eps}` in pixels corresponding
to the disparity value at the same image coordinates in the disparity image.
The confidence image contains the corresponding confidence value :math:`c`
between 0 and 1. The confidence is defined as the probability of the true
disparity value being within the interval of three times the error around the
measured disparity :math:`d`, i.e., :math:`[d-3d_{eps}, d+3d_{eps}]`.
Thus, the disparity image with error and confidence values can be used in
applications requiring probabilistic inference. The confidence and error values
corresponding to an invalid disparity measurement will be 0.

The disparity error :math:`d_{eps}` (in pixels) can be converted to a depth error :math:`z_{eps}`
(in meters) using the focal length :math:`f` (in pixels), the baseline :math:`t` (in meters), and the disparity
value :math:`d` (in pixels) of the same pixel in the disparity image:

.. math::
   z_{eps}=\frac{d_{eps}\cdot f\cdot t}{d^2}.
   :label: eq-deptherror

Combining equations :eq:`reconstruction` and :eq:`eq-deptherror` allows the
depth error to be related to the depth:

.. math::
   z_{eps}=\frac{d_{eps}\cdot{P_z}^2}{f\cdot t}.

With the focal lengths and baselines of the different |rc_visard| models and the typical combined
calibration and stereo matching error :math:`d_{eps}` of 0.25 pixels, the depth accuracy
can be visualized as shown below.

.. figure:: _plot/reconstruction_error.png
   :width: 60 %
   :align: center


.. index::
   pair: timestamp; image

The |rc_xxx| provides time-stamped disparity, error, and confidence images over the
GenICam interface (see :ref:`sect-provided-image-streams`:latex:`, \:Section \ref{gigevision:sect-provided-image-streams}`).
Live streams of the images are provided with reduced quality in the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`.

Parameters
----------

.. index::
   pair: parameters; disparity image
   pair: disparity image; Web GUI
   pair: depth image; Web GUI

The stereo matching component is called ``rc_stereomatching`` in the |rest-api| and it is represented by the
*Depth Image* tab in the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`.
The user can change the stereo matching parameters there, or use the |rest-api|
(:ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`, Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api}`) or GigE Vision
(:ref:`sect-genicam`:latex:`, Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam}`).

Parameter overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: _gen/nodes/params/rc_stereomatching.txt

Description of run-time parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each run-time parameter is represented by a row on the |webgui|'s *Depth Image* tab. The name in the
|webgui| is given in brackets behind the parameter name and the parameters are listed in the order
they appear in the |webgui|:

    :align: center

    The |webgui|'s *Depth Image* tab


.. index::
   pair: disparity image; frame rate

``acquisition_mode`` (*Acquisition Mode*)
    The acquisition mode can be set to ``Continuous``, ``SingleFrame`` (*Single*) or ``SingleFrameOut1`` (*Single + Out1*).
    The first one is the default, which performs stereo matching continuously according to the
    user defined frame rate and the available computation resources. The two other modes
    perform stereo matching upon each click of the *Acquire* button. The `Single + Out1`
    mode additionally controls an external projector that is connected to GPIO Out1
    (:ref:`sect-iocontrol`:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol}`). In this mode,
    ``out1_mode`` of the IOControl component is automatically set to ``ExposureAlternateActive`` upon each trigger call
    and reset to ``Low`` after receiving images for stereo matching.

    .. NOTE:: The ``Single + Out1`` mode can only change the ``out1_mode`` if the IOControl
       license is available on the |rc_xxx|.

    .. index::
       pair: quality; disparity image

    .. _expl-depth-quality:

``quality`` (*Quality*)
    Disparity images can be computed in different resolutions:
    ``High`` (640 x 480), ``Medium`` (320 x 240) and ``Low`` (214 x 160). The lower
    the resolution, the higher the frame rate of the disparity image. A 25 Hz frame
    rate can be achieved only at the lowest resolution. Please note that the frame
    rate of the disparity, confidence, and error images will always be less than or
    equal to the camera frame rate.

    Additionally, full resolution matching (``Full``) with 1280 x 960 pixel is possible with
    a valid StereoPlus license.

    .. only:: rc_visard

         If full resolution is selected, the depth range is internally limited due to
         limited on-board memory resources. It is recommended to adjust ``mindepth``
         and ``maxdepth`` to the depth range that is required by the application.

.. index::
   pair: double_shot; disparity image

.. _expl-depth-double-shot:

``double_shot`` (*Double-Shot*)
   This mode is intended for scenes recorded with a projector in ``Single + Out1`` acquisition
   mode, or in continuous acquisition mode with the projector in ``ExposureAlternateActive`` mode. 
   Holes caused by reflections of the projector are filled with depth information computed from 
   the images without projector pattern. It must only be enabled if the scene does not
   change during the acquisition of the images.

.. index::
   pair: static_scene; disparity image

.. _expl-depth-static:

``static_scene`` (*Static*)
   This option averages 8 consecutive camera images before matching. This reduces
   noise, which improves the stereo matching result. However, the latency increases significantly.
   The timestamp of the first
   image is taken as timestamp of the disparity image. This option only affects
   matching in full or high quality. It must only be enabled if the scene does not
   change during the acquisition of the 8 images.

   .. _expl-depth-min-depth:

   .. index::
      single: minimum distance

``mindepth`` (*Minimum Distance*)
   The minimum distance is the smallest distance from the camera
   at which measurements should be possible. Larger values implicitly reduce the
   disparity range, which also reduces the computation time. The minimum distance
   is given in meters.

   Depending on the capabilities of the sensor, the actual minimum distance
   can be higher than the user setting. The actual minimum distance will be
   reported in the status values.

   .. only:: rc_visard

      In ``quality`` mode ``Full``, the actual minimum distance can also be higher
      than the user-defined minimum distance due to memory limitations. In this
      case, lowering the maximum distance helps to reduce the actual minimum distance.

   .. _expl-depth-max-depth:

   .. index::
      single: maximum distance

``maxdepth`` (*Maximum Distance*)
   The maximum distance is the largest distance from the camera
   at which measurements should be possible. Pixels with larger distance values are
   set to invalid in the disparity image. Setting this value to its maximum permits
   values up to infinity. The maximum distance is given in meters.

   .. only:: rc_visard

      In ``quality`` mode ``Full``, the actual minimum distance can be higher
      than the user-defined minimum distance due to memory limitations. In this
      case, lowering the maximum distance helps to reduce the actual minimum distance.

   .. index::
      pair: smooth; disparity image

   .. _expl-depth-smooth:

``smooth`` (*Smoothing*)
   This option activates advanced smoothing of disparity values. It is only
   available with a valid StereoPlus license.

   .. _expl-depth-fill:

   .. index::
      single: fill-in

``fill`` (*Fill-in*)
   This option is used to fill holes in the disparity image by interpolation.
   The fill-in value is the maximum allowed disparity step on the border of the
   hole. Larger fill-in values can decrease the number of holes, but the interpolated
   values can have larger errors. At most 5% of pixels are interpolated. Interpolation
   of small holes is prefered over interpolation of larger holes. The confidence for
   the interpolated pixels is set to a low value of 0.5. A fill-in value of 0
   switches hole filling off.

   .. _expl-depth-seg:

   .. index::
      single: segmentation

``seg`` (*Segmentation*)
   The segmentation parameter is used to set the minimum number of
   pixels that a connected disparity region in the disparity image must fill.
   Isolated regions that are smaller are set to invalid in the disparity image.
   The value is related to the high quality disparity image with 640 x 480
   pixels resolution and does not have to be scaled when a different quality
   is chosen. Segmentation is useful for removing erroneous disparities. However,
   larger values may also remove real objects.

   .. _expl-depth-min-conf:

   .. index::
      single: minimum confidence
      pair: confidence; minimum

``minconf`` (*Minimum Confidence*)
   The minimum confidence can be set to filter potentially false disparity measurements.
   All pixels with less confidence than the chosen value are set to invalid
   in the disparity image.

   .. _expl-depth-max-depth-err:

   .. index::
      single: maximum depth error
      pair: depth error; maximum

``maxdeptherr`` (*Maximum Depth Error*)
   The maximum depth error is used to filter measurements
   that are too inaccurate. All pixels with a larger depth error than the chosen
   value are set to invalid in the disparity image. The maximum
   depth error is given in meters. The depth error generally grows quadratically
   with an object's distance from the camera (see :ref:`sect-confidence-error`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-confidence-error}`).


The same parameters are also available over the GenICam interface with slightly different names and partly with different data types
(see :ref:`sect-genicam`:latex:`, Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam}`).
