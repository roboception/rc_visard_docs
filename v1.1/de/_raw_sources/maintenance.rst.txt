Maintenance
===========

.. Warning:: The customer does not need to open the |rcvisard|'s housing to perform
      maintenance. Unauthorized opening will void the warranty.


.. ifconfig:: not kuka

   .. _sect-lens-cleaning:

   Lens cleaning
   -------------

   Glass lenses with antireflective coating are used to reduce glare. Please take special
   care when cleaning the lenses. To clean them, use a soft lens-cleaning brush to remove
   dust or dirt particles. Then use a clean microfiber cloth that is designed to clean lenses,
   and gently wipe the lens using a circular motion to avoid scratches that may compromise
   the sensor's performance. For stubborn dirt, high purity isopropanol or a lens cleaning
   solution formulated for coated lenses (such as the Uvex Clear family of products) may be used.

   .. _sect-maintenance-camera-calibration:

   Camera calibration
   ------------------

   The cameras are calibrated during production. Under normal operation conditions, the calibration
   will be valid for the life time of the sensor. High impact, such as occurring when dropping
   the |rc_visard|, can change the camera's parameters slightly. In this case, calibration can
   be verified and recalibration undertaken via the |webgui|
   (see :doc:`camera_calibration`:latex:`, Section \ref{camera_calibration:sect-camera-calibration}`).

.. _sect-updating-the-firmware:

Updating the firmware
---------------------

.. index::
   pair: firmware; version
   pair: firmware; update
   pair: firmware; mender
   single: Web GUI; update

Information about the current firmware image version can be found on the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`'s :latex:`(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})` *System* tab
in the *System information* row.
It can also be accessed via the |rcvisard|'s
:ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`
using the :http:get:`/system` request. Users can use either the |webgui| or the |restapi|
to update the firmware.

.. Warning:: After a firmware update, all of the software components' configured parameters
      will be reset to their defaults.
      Please make sure these settings are persisted on the application-side
      or client PC (e.g., using the
      :ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`, Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api}`)
      to request all parameters and store them prior to executing the update.

      The following settings are excluded from this and will be
      persisted across a firmware update:

      -  the |rcvisard|'s network configuration including an optional static IP address and the
         user-specifed device name,
      -  the latest result of the :doc:`handeye_calibration`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})`,
         i.e., recalibrating the |rcvisard| w.r.t. a robot is not required, unless mounting
         has changed, and
      -  the latest result of the :doc:`camera_calibration`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{camera_calibration:sect-camera-calibration})`,
         i.e., recalibration of the |rcvisard|'s stereo cameras is not required.


Step 1: Download the newest firmware version.
   Firmware updates will be supplied from of a Mender artifact file
   identified by its ``.mender`` suffix.

   .. ifconfig:: not kuka

      If a new firmware update is available for your |rcvisard| device, the
      respective file can be downloaded to a local computer from
      http://www.roboception.com/download.


Step 2: Upload the update file.
   To update with the |rcvisard|'s |restapi|, users
   may refer to the :http:post:`/system/update` request.

   To update the firmware via the |webgui|, locate the *Software Update* row
   on the *System* tab
   and press the *Upload Update* button (see :numref:`fig-update-system-tab`).
   Select the desired update image file (file extension ``.mender``)
   from the local file system and open it to start the update.

      Web GUI *System* tab

   .. note:: Depending on the network architecture and configuration the
         upload may take several minutes. During the update via the |webgui|,
         a progress bar indicates the progress of the upload as shown in
         :numref:`fig-update-progress-bar`.

      Software update progress bar

   .. Note:: Depending on the web browser, the update progress status shown in :numref:`fig-update-progress-bar`
      may indicate the completion of the update too early. Please wait until the context window shown in
      :numref:`fig-update-reboot` opens. Expect an overall update time of at least five minutes.

      Software Update Rebooting Screen

   .. Warning:: Do not close the web-browser tab which contains the Web GUI or press the renew
      button on this tab, because it will abort the update procedure. In that case,
      repeat the update procedure from the beginning.

Step 3: Reboot the |rcvisard|.
   To apply a firmware update to the |rcvisard|
   device, a reboot is required after having uploaded the new image version.

   .. index::
      single: active partition
      single: inactive partition

   .. Note:: The new image version is uploaded to the inactive partition of the |rcvisard|. Only after rebooting
      will the inactive partition be activated, and the active partition will become inactive.
      If the updated firmware image cannot be loaded, this partition of the |rcvisard| remains inactive and
      the previously installed firmware version from the active partition will be used automatically.

   As for the |restapi|, the reboot can be performed by the
   :http:put:`/system/reboot` request.

   After having uploaded the new firmware via the |webgui|, a context window
   is opened as shown in :numref:`fig-update-reboot` offering to reboot
   the device immediately or to postpone it. To reboot the |rcvisard|
   at a later time, use the *Reboot* button on the |webgui|'s *System* tab.

Step 4: Confirm the firmware update.
   After rebooting the |rcvisard|, please check the firmware image version
   number of the currently active image to make sure that the updated image
   was successfully loaded. You can do so either via the
   |webgui|'s *System* tab or via the |restapi|'s :http:get:`/system/update` request.

   Please contact |company| in case the firmware update could not be applied successfully.


.. _sect-restoring-the-previous-firmware-version:

Restoring the previous firmware version
---------------------------------------

.. index::
   pair: rollback; firmware
   single: inactive partition

After a successful firmware update, the previous firmware image is stored on
the inactive partition of the |rcvisard| and can be restored in case needed.
This procedure is called a *rollback*.

.. note:: Using the latest firmware as provided
      by |company| is strongly recommended. Hence, rollback functionality should only be
      used  in case of serious issues with the updated firmware version.

Rollback functionality is only accessible via the |rcvisard|'s
:ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`
using the :http:put:`/system/rollback` request. It can be issued
using any HTTP-compatible client or using a web browser as described in
:ref:`sect-swagger-ui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-swagger-ui})`.
Like the update process, the rollback requires a subsequent device reboot
to activate the restored firmware version.

.. Warning:: Like during a firmware update, all software components'
      parameters will be reset to their defaults. Please make sure
      these settings are persisted on the application-side
      or client PC (e.g., using the
      :ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`, Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api}`)
      prior to executing the rollback.

.. _sect-rebooting:

Rebooting the |rcvisard|
------------------------

.. index::
   single: reboot

An |rcvisard| reboot is necessary after updating the firmware or
performing a software rollback. It can be issued either
programmatically, via the |rcvisard|'s
:ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`
using the :http:put:`/system/reboot` request, or manually on the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`'s :latex:`(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})` *System* tab.
The reboot is finished when the LED turns green again.


.. _sect-updating-license:

Updating the software license
-----------------------------

Licenses that are purchased from |company| for enabling additional features can be installed
via the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`'s :latex:`(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})` *System* panel.
The |rcvisard| has to be rebooted to apply the licenses.


.. _sect-downloading-log-files:

Downloading log files
---------------------

.. index::
   pair: log files; download
   single: Web GUI; logs

During operation, the |rcvisard| logs important information, warnings, and errors into files. If the |rcvisard| exhibits unexpected
or erroneous behavior, the log files can be used to trace its origin.
Log messages can be viewed and filtered using
the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`'s :latex:`(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})` *Logs* tab. If contacting the
support (:ref:`sect-contact`:latex:`, Section \ref{contact:sect-contact}`), the log files
are very useful for tracking possible problems. To download them as a .tar.gz file,
click on *Download all logs* on the |webgui|'s *Logs* tab.

Besides the |webgui|, the logs are also accessible via the |rcvisard|'s
:ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`
using the :http:get:`/logs` and :http:get:`/logs/{log}` requests.
