Software components
===================

The |rc_visard| comes with several on-board software components, which provide camera images,
3D information, and dynamics state estimates, and allow calibration to be performed.
Each software component
corresponds to a *node* in the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`.
:numref:`fig-component-flowchart` gives an overview of the relationships between the different software
components and the data they provide via |rcvisard|'s various
:ref:`interfaces <sect-interfaces>`:latex:`\:(Section
\ref{interfaces:sect-interfaces})`.

.. Note:: Components marked as *optional* extend the |rc_visard|'s features.
   Customers can extend the license to purchase additional components.

The |rc_visard|'s on-board software consists of the following components:

- :doc:`stereo_camera` (``rc_stereocamera``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-stereo-camera}`)
   acquires stereo image pairs and performs planar rectification for using the
   stereo camera as a measurement device.
   Images are provided both for further internal processing by other components
   and for external use as :ref:`GenICam image streams <sect-genicam>`.

- :doc:`stereo_matching` (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`)
   uses the rectified stereo image pair to compute 3D depth
   information such as disparity, error, and confidence images.
   These are provided as GenICam streams, too.

- :doc:`dynamics` (``rc_dynamics``:latex:`, Section \ref{dynamics:sect-dynamics}.`)
   provides estimates of |rc_visard|'s dynamic state such as its pose,
   velocity, and acceleration. These states are transmitted
   as continuous data streams via the :doc:`rc_dynamics interface<rc_dynamics>`.
   For this purpose, the dynamics component manages and fuses data from the following individual
   subcomponents:

   - :doc:`stereo_visodo` (``rc_stereovisodo``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_visodo:sect-visual-odometry}`)
      estimates the motion of the |rc_visard| device based on the motion of characteristic
      visual features in the left camera images.

   - :doc:`stereo_ins` (``rc_stereo_ins``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_ins:sect-stereo-ins}`)
      combines visual odometry measurements with readings from the on-board
      Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to provide
      accurate and high-frequency state estimates in real time.

- :doc:`camera_calibration` (``rc_cameracalib``:latex:`, Section \ref{camera_calibration:sect-camera-calibration}`)
   automatically checks and performs the self-calibration of the |rc_visard|'s
   stereo camera in case it has been decalibrated. It furthermore
   enables the user to check and perform recalibration manually via the
   :ref:`WEB GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`.

- :doc:`handeye_calibration` (``rc_hand_eye_calibration``:latex:`, Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration}`)
   enables the user to calibrate the |rc_visard| with respect to a robot,
   either via the |webgui| or the |restapi|.
