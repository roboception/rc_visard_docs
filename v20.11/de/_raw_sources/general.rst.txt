Overview
========

.. only:: rc_cube

    The |rc_xxx| is a high-performance 3D-image-processing device that is developed to
    enhance the computing capabilities of the |company| stereo-camera |rc_visard|.

.. only:: rc_visard

    The 3D sensor |rc_visard| is an IP54-protected, self-registering stereo-camera
    with on-board computing capabilities.

The |rc_xxx| provides real-time camera images and disparity images, which can
also be used to compute depth images and 3D point clouds. Additionally, it provides
confidence and error images as quality measures for each image acquisition.
It offers an intuitive web UI (user interface) and a standardized
GenICam interface, making it compatible with all major image processing
libraries.

With optionally available |rc_reason| modules the |rc_xxx| provides out-of-the-box solutions
for object detection and robotic pick-and-place applications.

.. only:: rc_visard

    The |rc_visard| also provides self-localization based on image and inertial data.
    A mobile navigation solution can be established with the optional on-board SLAM module.

    The |rc_visard| is offered with two different stereo baselines: The |rc_visard| 65
    is optimally suited for mounting on robotic manipulators, whereas the |rc_visard| 160 can be employed as a navigation or as externally-fixed sensor.
    The |rc_xxx|'s intuitive calibration, configuration, and use enable 3D vision for everyone.

          |rc_visard| 65 and |rc_visard| 160

    The terms "sensor," "|rc_visard| 65," and "|rc_visard| 160" used throughout the manual all refer to the |company| |rc_visard| family of self-registering cameras.
    Installation and control for all sensors are exactly the same, and all use the same mounting base.

    .. NOTE:: Unless specified, the information provided in this manual applies to both the |rc_visard| 65 and |rc_visard| 160 versions of the |company| sensor.

.. NOTE:: This manual uses the metric system and mostly uses the units meter and
   millimeter. Unless otherwise specified, all dimensions in technical drawings are
   in millimeters.
