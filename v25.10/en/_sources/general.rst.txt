Overview

The 3D sensor

rc_visard

 is an IP54-protected , self-registering stereo-camera with on-board
computing capabilities.

The

rc_visard

 provides real-time camera images and depth images, which can be used
to compute 3D point clouds. Additionally, it provides confidence and
error images as quality measures for each image acquisition. It offers
an intuitive web UI (user interface) and standardized interfaces,
making it compatible with all major image processing libraries.

With optionally available software modules the

rc_visard

 provides out-of-the-box solutions for object detection and robotic
pick-and-place applications.

The

rc_visard

 also provides self-localization based on image and inertial data. A
mobile navigation solution can be established with the optional on-
board SLAM module.

The

rc_visard

 is offered with two different stereo baselines: The

rc_visard

 65 is optimally suited for mounting on robotic manipulators, whereas
the

rc_visard

 160 can be employed as a navigation or as externally-fixed sensor.

The

rc_visard

's intuitive calibration, configuration, and use enable 3D vision for
everyone.


The terms "sensor," "

rc_visard

 65," and "

rc_visard

 160" used throughout the manual all refer to the Roboception

rc_visard

 family of self-registering cameras. Installation and control for all
sensors are exactly the same, and all use the same mounting base.

Note: Unless specified, the information provided in this manual
  applies to both the

  rc_visard

   65 and

  rc_visard

   160 versions of the Roboception

  rc_visard

   sensor.

Note: This manual uses the metric system and mostly uses the units
  meter and millimeter. Unless otherwise specified, all dimensions in
  technical drawings are in millimeters.
