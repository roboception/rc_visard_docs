Sensor dynamics
===============

The dynamics component provides estimates of the sensor state. These include pose, linear velocity, linear acceleration,
and rotational rates. The component handles starting and stopping, and streaming of the estimates for individual subcomponents:

- :doc:`stereo_visodo` (``rc_stereovisodo``)
   estimates the camera's motion from the motion of characteristic image points in the left camera images\ :latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_visodo:sect-visual-odometry})`.

- :doc:`stereo_ins` (``rc_stereo_ins``)
   combines visual odometry measurements with readings from an inertial measurement unit (:term:`IMU`) to provide
   accurate, high-frequency state estimates in real time\ :latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_ins:sect-stereo-ins})`.

- :doc:`slam` (``rc_slam``)
   performs simultaneous localization and mapping (:term:`SLAM`) for correcting accumulated
   poses\ :latex:`\:(Section \ref{slam:sect-slam})`.

.. _sect-coordinate-frames-state-estimation:

Coordinate frames for state estimation
--------------------------------------

.. index::
   pair: coordinate frames; state estimation

The world coordinate frame for state estimation is defined as follows: The
coordinate frame's z-axis points upward and is aligned with the gravity vector. The x-axis
is orthogonal to the z-axis and points in the |rc_visard|'s viewing direction at the
time when the pose estimation starts. The world
frame's origin is located at the origin of the |rc_visard|'s IMU coordinate frame at the instant
when state estimation is switched on.

If pose estimation is switched on when the |rc_visard|'s viewing direction parallels
the gravity vector (with a tolerance range of 10 degrees), then the world coordinate frame's y-axis
is aligned either with the IMU's positive or negative x-axis. In this orientation, the
initial alignment of the world coordinate frame is no longer continuous. Thus, special care has to
be taken when pose estimation has to be started at such an orientation.


.. figure:: images/pose_frames.*

   Coordinate frames for state estimation. The IMU coordinate frame is inside the |rc_visard|'s housing.
   The :ref:`camera coordinate frame<sect-coordinate-frames>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{hardware_spec:sect-coordinate-frames})`
   is in the focal point of the left camera.

The transformation between the IMU coordinate frame and the camera/sensor frame is also
estimated and provided in the *real-time dynamics stream* over the rc_dynamics interface
(see :ref:`sect-interfaces`:latex:`, Section \ref{interfaces:sect-interfaces}`).


.. warning:: The stereo INS component self-calibrates the IMU during its initialization.
    It is therefore required that the |rc_visard| is not moving and sufficient
    texture is visible during startup of the stereo INS component.

loop-closure corrected estimates and is equivalent to the stream from :doc:`stereo_ins`
when SLAM is not running.

Camera-pose streams (``pose`` and ``pose_ins``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
    pair: camera; pose stream
    single: 3D modeling
    pair: frame rate; pose
    pair: data stream; pose

The *camera-pose streams*  called ``pose`` and ``pose_ins`` are provided at |cam-rate| with
timestamps that correspond to image timestamps. The
former stream is the best-effort estimate, combining ``rc_slam`` and ``rc_stereo_ins`` if the :doc:`SLAM<slam>` component is
running. If SLAM is not running, then both data streams are equivalent. Pose
values are given in world coordinates, and also refer to the |rc_visard|'s camera
frame origin
(see :ref:`sect-coordinate-frames-state-estimation`:latex:`, Section \ref{dynamics:sect-coordinate-frames-state-estimation}`).
They are the
most accurate estimates, taking all available |rc_visard| information into consideration.
They can be used in modeling applications, where camera images, depth images,
or point clouds have to be aligned highly accurately with each other. To ensure
the greatest possible accuracy, these pose values are delayed until a corresponding
visual odometry measurement is available.

.. _sect-datastream-pose-rt:

Real-time camera-pose streams (``pose_rt`` and ``pose_rt_ins``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   single: pose stream
   pair: frame rate; pose
   pair: data stream; pose_rt

Two *real-time pose streams* called ``pose_rt`` and ``pose_rt_ins`` are provided at the IMU rate of |imu-rate|. The
former stream is the best-effort estimate, combining ``rc_slam`` and ``rc_stereo_ins`` when the SLAM component is
running. If SLAM is not running, then both data streams are equivalent. They consist of the
pose estimates of the |rc_visard|'s camera frame origin (see :ref:`sect-coordinate-frames-state-estimation`:latex:`, Section \ref{dynamics:sect-coordinate-frames-state-estimation}`)
in world coordinates. The
values given in these streams correspond to the values in the *real-time dynamics streams*,
but give the pose of the sensor/camera coordinate frame instead of that of the IMU coordinate frame.


.. _sect-datastream-dynamics:

Real-time dynamics streams (``dynamics`` and ``dynamics_ins``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   single: real-time pose
   single: dynamics stream
   pair: frame rate; pose
   pair: data stream; dynamics

Two *real-time dynamics streams* called ``dynamics`` and ``dynamics_ins`` are provided at the IMU rate of |imu-rate|. The
former stream is the best-effort estimate, combining ``rc_slam`` and ``rc_stereo_ins`` when the SLAM component is
running. If SLAM is not running, then both data streams are equivalent. The
estimates can be used for real-time control of a robot. Since the values are provided
in real time and visual odometry computation requires some processing time,
the latest visual odometry estimate may not be included.
Therefore, these estimates are in general slightly less accurate than those in the
non-real-time *camera-pose streams* (see above), but are the best estimates
available at this instant. The provided dynamics streams contain the |rc_visard|'s

.. index::

  pair: transformation; camera to IMU

- transformation from camera to IMU coordinate frame as pose with frame name and parent frame name.

.. index::
  pair: coordinate frames; dynamics

For each component, the stream also provides the name of the coordinate
frame in which the values are given. Translation, rotation, and linear velocities
are given in the world frame; angular velocities and accelerations are
given in the IMU frame (see :ref:`sect-coordinate-frames-state-estimation`:latex:`,
Section \ref{dynamics:sect-coordinate-frames-state-estimation}`).
All values refer to the IMU frame's origin. That
means, for example, that linear velocity is the velocity of the IMU frame's origin in the world frame.

..
	Additionally, the stream contains the full 21 x 21 covariance matrix of the states.
	The covariance matrix is filled with the covariances of the state values in the same
	order as listed above. The covariance of the rotation is given in Euler angles, which
	are equal to an angle-axis representation assuming a small angle approximation.

..
	|TODO| Which Euler angles. Definition?

.. index::
  pair: SLAM; jump flag
  pair: dynamics; jump flag

Lastly, the stream contains a ``possible_jump`` flag, which is set to *true* whenever
the optional SLAM component (see :doc:`slam`:latex:`, Section \ref{slam:sect-slam}`)
corrects the state estimation after finding a loop
closure. The state estimate can jump in this case, which should be considered when
the values are used in a control loop. If SLAM is not running, the jump flag can be
ignored and will stay *false*.

The *IMU data stream* called ``imu`` is provided at the IMU rate of |imu-rate|. It consists of the
acceleration in x, y, z directions plus the angular velocities around these three axis.
The values are calibrated but not bias- and gravity-compensated, and are given in the IMU frame. The transformation
between IMU and sensor frame is provided in the *real-time dynamics stream*.

   Simplified state and transition diagram

These services shall respond quickly. Therefore, for services that cause a state transition
the value of the returned ``current_state`` in general is the first new (intermediate) state that was
transitioned to, not the final state.
E.g., for the ``start`` command the returned ``current_state`` will be WAITING_FOR_INS, not state
RUNNING. If the transition does not take place within 0.1 seconds, the
current state is returned. See :numref:`tab-rc-dynamics-states` for the meaning of the returned state codes.

.. NOTE:: The state ``FATAL`` can only be left by calling ``stop``, which performs
          a transition to the state ``IDLE``. The services ``restart`` and
          ``restart_slam`` internally use ``stop`` and will also work as
          expected. ``start`` and ``start_slam`` only work if the state is
          ``IDLE``, and do nothing if the state is ``FATAL``.

.. NOTE:: The dynamics components can also be started and stopped on the
          *Dynamics* page of the :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`.
