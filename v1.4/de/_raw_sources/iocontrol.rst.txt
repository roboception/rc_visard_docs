IO and Projector Control
========================

The IOControl component allows reading the status of the general purpose
digital inputs and controlling the digital general purpose outputs (:ref:`sect-wiring`:latex:`,
Section \ref{hardware_spec:sect-wiring}`). The outputs can be set to low or high,
or configured to be high for the exposure time of every image. Additionally, the
outputs can be configured to be high for the exposure time of every second image.

.. Note::

   The IOControl component is optional and requires the purchase of a separate
   :ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})`.

.. _sect-iocontrol-parameters:

Parameters
----------

The IOControl component is called ``rc_iocontrol`` in the |rest-api|.
The user can change the parameters via |rest-api|
(:ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`, Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api}`) or GigE Vision
using the DigitalIOControl parameters ``LineSelector`` and ``LineSource``
(:ref:`sect-genicam-iocontrol`:latex:`, Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam-iocontrol}`).

Description of run-time parameters
..................................

``out1_mode`` and ``out2_mode`` (*Out1* and *Out2*)
    The output modes for GPIO Out 1 and Out 2 can be set individually:

    ``Low`` sets the ouput permanently to low. This is the factory default of Out 2.

    ``High`` sets the output permanently to high.

    ``ExposureActive`` sets the output to high for the exposure time of every
    image. This is the factory default of Out 1.

    ``ExposureAlternateActive`` sets the output to high for the exposure time
    of every second image.

.. Note::

   The parameters can only be changed if the IOControl license is available on
   the |rc_visard|. Otherwise, the parameters will stay at their factory
   defaults, i.e. ``out1_mode`` = ``ExposureActive`` and ``out2_mode`` = ``Low``.

Figure :numref:`fig-fps-exposure` shows which images are used for stereo
matching and transmission via GigE Vision in ``ExposureActive`` mode with a
user defined frame rate of 8 Hz.

.. _fig-fps-exposure:
.. figure:: images/fps_exposure.*
   :width: 100 %
   :align: center

   Example of using the ``ExposureActive`` mode for GPIO Out 1 with a user defined
   frame rate setting of 8 Hz. The internal image acquisition is always |cam-rate|.
   GPIO Out 1 is high for the exposure time of every image. A disparity
   image is computed for camera images that are send out via GigE Vision according
   to the user defined frame rate.

The mode ``ExposureAlternateActive`` is meant to be used when an external random
dot projector is connected to the GPIO Out 1 of the |rc_visard|.
A side effect of setting output 1 to ``ExposureAlternateActive`` is that the
:ref:`stereo matching<sect-stereo-matching>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching})`
component only uses images if output 1 is high, i.e. projector is on. The maximum
framerate that is used for stereo matching is therefore halve of the frame rate
configured by the user
(see :ref:`FPS<expl-fps>`:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}`). All other
components like
:ref:`visual odometry<sect-visual-odometry>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{stereo_visodo:sect-visual-odometry})`,
:ref:`TagDetect<sect-tag-detection>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{tagdetect:sect-tag-detection})` and
:ref:`ItemPick<sect-itempick>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick})`
use images where the output is low, i.e. projector is off. Figure
:numref:`fig-fps-alternate` shows an example.

.. _fig-fps-alternate:
.. figure:: images/fps_alternate.*
   :width: 100 %
   :align: center

   Example of using the ``ExposureAlternateActive`` mode for GPIO Out 1 with a user
   defined frame rate setting of 8 Hz. The internal image acquisition is always |cam-rate|.
   GPIO Out 1 is high for the exposure time of every second image. A disparity
   image is computed for images where Out 1 is high and that are send out via GigE
   Vision according to the user defined frame rate. In ``ExposureAlternateActive``
   mode, images are always transmitted pairwise. One with Out 1 high for which a
   disparity image might be available and one with Out 1 low.

.. Note:: In ``ExposureAlternateActive`` mode, an image with output high (i.e. with
   projection) is always 40 ms away from an image with output low (i.e. without
   projection), regardless of the user configured frame rate. This needs to be
   considered when synchronizing disparity and camera images without projection
   in this special mode.

The functionality can also be controlled by the digital IO control parameters
of the GenICam interface (:ref:`sect-genicam-iocontrol`:latex:`, Section \ref{gigevision:sect-genicam-iocontrol}`).

Services
--------

The IOControl component offers the following services.

``get_io_values``
   This service call retrieves the current state of the general purpose inputs
   and outputs. The returned time stamp is the time of measurement. The call
   returns an error if the |rc_visard| does not have an IOControl license.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_iocontrol_get_io_values.txt

``save_parameters``
   With this service call, the component's current parameter settings are
   persisted to the |rcvisard|. That is, these values are applied even after
   reboot.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_iocontrol_save_parameters.txt

``reset_defaults``
   Restores and applies the default values for this component's parameters
   ("factory reset").

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_iocontrol_reset_defaults.txt

   .. WARNING:: The user must be aware that calling this service causes the
      current parameter settings for the IOControl component to be
      irrecoverably lost.
