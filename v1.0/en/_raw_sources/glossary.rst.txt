   DHCP
      The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to automatically assign an
      :term:`IP` address to a network device. Some DHCP servers only accept known devices.
      In this case, an administrator needs to configure the DHCP server with the
      fixed :term:`MAC address` of a device.

   .. disparity
   .. disparity image
   ..   Disparity is the displacement of the projections of an object point in two camera
   ..   images. If the images are :term:`rectified`, then the disparity is the difference
   ..   between the column index of the projection in the left image and the column index
   ..   of the projection in the right image. The disparity is inversely proportional to
   ..   the distance (i.e., depth)
   ..   of the object point from the camera and becomes 0 if the object point is at infinity.
   ..   A disparity image contains disparities for each pixel.

   DNS
   mDNS
      The Domain Name Server (DNS) manages the host names and :term:`IP` addresses of all
      network devices. It is responsible for resolving the host name into the IP address for
      communication with a device. A DNS can be configured to get this information
      automatically when a device appears on a network or manually by an administrator. In
      contrast, *multicast DNS* (mDNS) works without a central server by querying all devices
      on a local network each time a host name needs to be resolved. mDNS is available by
      default on Linux and Mac operating systems and is used when '.local' is appended to a host
      name.

   GenICam
      GenICam is a generic standard interface for cameras. It serves as a unified interface
      around other standards such as :term:`GigE Vision`, Camera Link, USB, etc. See
      http://genicam.org for more information.

   GigE
      Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) is a networking technology for transmitting data at
      one gigabit per second.

   GigE Vision
      GigE Vision\ |reg| is a standard for configuring cameras and transmitting images over a
      :term:`GigE` network link. See http://gigevision.com for more information.

   IMU
      An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) consists of three accelerometers and three gyroscopes
      that measure the linear accelerations and the turn rates in all three dimensions.

   INS
      An Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a 3D measurement system which uses inertial
      measurements (accelerations and turn rates) to compute position and orientation information.
      If combined with a visual measurement instrument, it is called Visual Inertial Navigation
      System (VINS).

   IP
   IP address
      The Internet Protocol (IP) is a standard for sending data between devices in a computer
      network. Every device requires an IP address, which must be unique in the network.
      The IP address can be configured by :term:`DHCP`, :term:`Link Local`, or manually.

   Link Local
      Link Local is a technology where network devices associate themselves with an :term:`IP address`
      and check if it is unique in the local network. Link Local can be used if
      :term:`DHCP` is unavailable and manual IP configuration is not or cannot be done.
      Link Local is especially useful for connecting a network device directly to a
      host computer. By default, Windows 10 reverts automatically to Link Local if
      DHCP is unavailable. Under Linux, Link Local must be enabled manually in the network
      manager.

   MAC address
      The Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique, persistent address for
      networking devices. It is also known as the hardware address of a device. In contrast
      to the :term:`IP address`, the MAC address is (normally) permanently given to
      a device and does not change.

   .. pose
   ..   A pose represents an object's *position* and *orientation*
   ..   relative to some *reference coordinate system* or *reference frame*.
   ..   It can be described by means of a rotation and translation transformation
   ..   that brings the object from a reference pose to the observed pose.
   ..   This rotation transformation can be represented in different ways, e.g.,
   ..   as a rotation matrix or a quaternion.

   .. rectification
   .. rectified
   ..   Rectification is a transformation process for images. In a stereo camera setting,
   ..   both images are often projected onto a common plane with parallel optical axes.
   ..   The resulting rectified images are free of lens distortion. Moreover,
   ..   an object point in the scene is always projected into the same row in both images.
   ..   The column index will be the same if the object point is at infinity. For closer
   ..   objects, the column index in the right image will be smaller than in the left image.

   SDK
      A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools or
      a collection of software modules.

   SLAM
      SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping and describes the process of
      creating a map of an unknown environment and simultaneously updating the sensor pose
      within the map.

   SGM
      SGM stands for Semi-Global Matching and is a state-of-the-art stereo matching algorithm
      which offers brief run times and a great accuracy, especially at object borders, fine
      structures, and in weakly textured areas.

   UDP
      The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the minimal message-oriented transport
      layer of the Internet Protocol (:term:`IP`) family. It uses a simple
      connectionless transmission model with a minimum of protocol mechanism
      such as integrity verification (via checksum). The |rcvisard| uses UDP
      for publishing its
      :ref:`estimated dynamical states <sect-dynamics-streams>`:latex:`\:(Section
      \ref{dynamics:sect-dynamics-streams})`
      via the
      :ref:`rc_dynamics interface <sect-rc-dynamics-interface>`:latex:`\:(Section
      \ref{rc_dynamics:sect-rc-dynamics-interface})`.
      To receive this data, applications may use datagram sockets to
      bind to the endpoint of the data transmission consisting in a combination
      of an :term:`IP address` and a service port number such as
      ``192.168.0.100:49500``, which is typically referred to as a
      *destination* of an rc_dynamics data stream in this documentation.

   URI
   URL
      A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters
      identifying resources of the |rcvisard|'s |restapi|. An example of such a
      URI is ``/nodes/rc_stereocamera/parameters/fps``, which points
      to the ``fps`` run-time parameter of the stereo camera component.

      A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) additionally specifies the full
      network location and protocol, i.e., an exemplary URL to locate the
      above resource would be
      ``https://<rcvisard>/api/v1/nodes/rc_stereocamera/parameters/fps``
      where ``<rcvisard>`` refers to the |rcvisard|'s :term:`IP address`.

   XYZABC format
      Format to represent a pose. See :ref:`sect-xyzabc-format`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{pose_formats:sect-xyzabc-format})`
      for its definition.

   XYZ+quaternion
      Format to represent a pose. See :ref:`sect-xyz-quaternion-format`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{pose_formats:sect-xyz-quaternion-format})`
      for its definition.
