Stereo INS
==========

The stereo-vision-aided Inertial Navigation System (:term:`INS`) component is part
of the sensor dynamics component. It combines visual-odometry measurements
with inertial measurement unit (:term:`IMU`) data and provides robust, low latency,
real-time state estimates at a high rate. The IMU consists of three
accelerometers and three gyroscopes, which measure accelerations and turn
rates in all three dimensions. By fusing IMU and visual-odometry measurements,
the state estimate has the same frequency as the IMU (|imu-rate|) and is
very robust even under challenging lighting conditions and for fast motions.

Parameters
----------

The stereo INS component's node name is ``rc_stereo_ins``.
