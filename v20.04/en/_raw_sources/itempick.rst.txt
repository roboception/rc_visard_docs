ItemPick and BoxPick
====================

.. index:: ! ItemPick
   single: bin picking
   single: grasp computation

.. index:: ! BoxPick

Introduction
------------

.. Short description and functionalities

The ItemPick and BoxPick components are optional on-board components of the |rc_xxx|.

.. Note::

   The components are optional and require separate ItemPick or BoxPick :ref:`licenses<sect-updating-license>`
   :latex:`(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased.

The components provide out-of-the-box perception solutions for robotic pick-and-place
applications. ItemPick targets the detection of flat surfaces of unknown objects for picking
with a suction gripper. BoxPick detects rectangular surfaces and determines their position,
orientation and size for grasping. The interface of both components is very similar. Therefore
both components are described together in this chapter.

In addition, both components offer:

- a dedicated page on the |rc_xxx| :ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`
  for easy setup, configuration, testing, and application tuning
- the definition of regions of interest to select relevant volumes in the scene
- a load carrier detection functionality for bin-picking applications,
  to provide grasps for items inside a bin only
- the definition of compartments inside a load carrier to provide grasps
  for specific volumes of the bin only
- support for static and robot-mounted cameras and
  optional integration with the :doc:`handeye_calibration`
  :latex:`(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})` component,
  to provide grasps in the user-configured external reference frame
- a quality value associated to each suggested grasp and related to the flatness of the grasping surface
- sorting of grasps according to gravity and size so that items on top of a pile are grasped first.

.. Note::

  In this chapter, cluster and surface are used as synonyms and identify a set of
  points (or pixels) with defined geometrical properties.

.. Note::

  In this chapter, load carrier and bin are used as synonyms and identify a
  container with four walls, a floor and a rectangular rim.

.. _sect-itempick-roi:

Setting a region of interest
----------------------------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; region of interest
   single: ItemPick; region of interest

A region of interest (ROI) defines a volume in space which is of interest for
a specific user-application.
A ROI can narrow the volume where a load carrier is searched, or select a volume
which only contains items to be grasped.
Processing times can significantly decrease when using a ROI.

The ItemPick and BoxPick components currently support regions of interest of the following types:

 - ``BOX``, with dimensions ``box.x``, ``box.y``, ``box.z``.
 - ``SPHERE``, with radius ``sphere.radius``.

The user can specify the region of interest ``pose`` in the ``camera`` or the ``external``
coordinate system (see :ref:`sect-itempick-hand-eye-dep`:latex:`, Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-hand-eye-dep}`).

Both components can persistently store up to 50 different regions of interest,
each one identified by a different ``id``.
The configuration of regions of interest is normally performed offline, during
the set up of the desired application.
This can be done via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` or in the |rcxxx| |webgui|.

.. Note::
  As opposed to the component parameters, the configured regions of interest
  are persistent even over firmware updates and rollbacks.

.. _sect-itempick-detect-lc:

Detection of load carriers
--------------------------

.. index::
   pair: BoxPick; load carrier
   pair: ItemPick; load carrier

A load carrier (bin) is a container with four walls, a floor and a rectangular rim.
It is defined by its ``outer_dimensions`` and ``inner_dimensions``.
The maximum ``outer_dimensions`` are 2.0 meters in every dimension.

.. Note::
  Typically, outer and inner dimensions of a load carrier are available in the
  specifications of the load carrier manufacturer.

.. The ``outer_dimensions`` identify the load carrier outer box and
.. are the dimensions of the load carrier bounding box.
.. The ``inner_dimensions`` identify the load carrier inner box and
.. are the dimension of the maximum box that can be completely
.. contained within the load carrier.
.. While the ``rim_thickness`` value is optionally used for detecting the load carrier,
.. the ``inner_dimensions`` are required to filter the load carrier
.. and keep only its content.

The ItemPick and BoxPick components can persistently store up to 50 different
load carrier models, each one identified by a different ``id``.
The configuration of a load carrier model is normally performed offline,
during the set up the desired application.
This can be done via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` or in the |rcxxx| |webgui|.

.. Note::
  As opposed to the component parameters, the configured load carrier models
  are persistent even over firmware updates and rollbacks.

The load carrier detection algorithm is based on the detection of the load carrier
rectangular rim. By default, the rectangular ``rim_thickness`` is computed from the
outer and inner dimensions. As an alternative, its value can also
be explicitly specified by the user.

The origin of a detected load carrier is in the center of the load carrier
outer box and its z axis is perpendicular to the load carrier floor.
The components also determine if the detected load carrier is ``overfilled``.

.. _fig-itempick-load-carrier:
.. figure:: images/itempick_load_carrier_reference_rim_sidebyside.*
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Load carrier models and reference frame.

The user can optionally specify a prior for the load carrier ``pose``.
The detected load carrier pose is guaranteed to have the minimum rotation
with respect to the load carrier prior pose.
If no prior is specified, the algorithm searches for a load carrier whose floor
is perpendicular to the estimated gravity vector.

.. Because of the symmetry of the load carrier model, there is an ambiguity
.. in the definition of the x axis sense.
.. :numref:`fig-itempick-load-carrier-orientation` visualizes how the sense of
.. the load carrier x axis is defined for rectangular load carriers.

.. _sect-itempick-detect-filling-level:

Detection of filling level
--------------------------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; filling level
   single: ItemPick; filling level

The ItemPick and BoxPick components offer the ``detect_filling_level``
service to compute the filling level of a detected load carrier.

The load carrier is subdivided in a configurable number of cells in a 2D grid.
The maximum number of cells is 10x10.
For each cell, the following values are reported:

- ``level_in_percent``: minimum, maximum and mean cell filling level in percent
  from the load carrier floor.
  These values can be larger than 100% if the cell is overfilled.
- ``level_free_in_meters``: minimum, maximum and mean cell free level in meters
  from the load carrier rim. These values can be negative if the cell is overfilled.
- ``cell_size``: dimensions of the 2D cell in meters.
- ``cell_position``: position of the cell center in meters
  (either in ``camera`` or ``external`` frame, see :ref:`sect-itempick-hand-eye-dep`:latex:`, Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-hand-eye-dep}`).
  The z-coordinate is on the level of the load carrier rim.
- ``coverage``: represents the proportion of valid pixels in this cell.
  It varies between 0 and 1 with steps of 0.1.
  A low coverage indicates that the cell contains several missing data
  (i.e. only a few points were actually measured in this cell).

These values are also calculated for the whole load carrier itself.
If no cell subdivision is specified, only the overall filling level is computed.

.. _fig-itempick-lc-filling-level:
.. figure:: images/itempick_lc_filling_level.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Visualizations of the load carrier filling level: overall filling level without
   grid (left), 4x3 grid (center), 8x8 grid (right).
   The load carrier content is shown in a green gradient from white
   (on the load carrier floor) to dark green.
   The overfilled regions are visualized in red. Numbers indicate cell IDs.

.. _sect-itempick-detect-items:

Detection of items (BoxPick)
----------------------------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; item model

The BoxPick component supports the detection of multiple ``item_models`` of
``type`` ``RECTANGLE``.
Each item model is defined by its minimum and maximum size, with the
minimum dimensions strictly smaller than the maximum dimensions.
The dimensions should be given fairly accurately to avoid misdetections, 
while still considering a certain tolerance to account for possible production variations 
and measurement inaccuracies. 

Optionally, further information can be given to the BoxPick component:

- The ID of the load carrier which contains the items to be detected.
- A compartment inside the load carrier where to detect items.
- The ID of the region of interest where to search for the load carriers, if a
  load carrier is set.
  Otherwise, the ID of the region of interest where to search for the items.

The detected ``item`` poses are given relative to the centers of the rectangles,
with the z axis pointing towards the camera.
Each detected item includes a ``uuid`` (Universally Unique Identifier) and the
``timestamp`` of the oldest image that was used to detect it.

.. _sect-itempick-compute-grasps:

Computation of grasps
---------------------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; grasp
   single: ItemPick; grasp

The ItemPick and BoxPick components offer a service for computing grasps for
suction grippers. The gripper is defined by its suction surface length and width.

The ItemPick component identifies flat surfaces in the scene and supports
flexible and/or deformable items. The ``type`` of these ``item_models`` is
called ``UNKNOWN`` since they don't need to have a standard geometrical shape.
Optionally, the user can also specify the minimum and maximum size of the item.

For BoxPick, the grasps are computed on the detected rectangular ``items``
(see :ref:`sect-itempick-detect-items`:latex:`, Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-detect-items}`).

Optionally, further information can be given to the components in a grasp
computation request:

- The ID of the load carrier which contains the items to be grasped.
- A compartment inside the load carrier where to compute grasps.
  The ``load_carrier_compartment`` is a box whose ``pose`` is defined with respect
  to the load carrier reference frame.

.. _fig-itempick-compartment:
.. figure:: images/itempick_load_carrier_compartment.*
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Compartment inside a load carrier.

- The ID of the region of interest where to search for the load carriers, if a
  load carrier is set.
  Otherwise, the ID of the region of interest where to compute grasps.
- Collision detection information: The ID of the gripper to enable collision checking and optionally
  a pre-grasp offset to define a pre-grasp position.
  The collision check requires a separate CollisionCheck :ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`
  :latex:`(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased. Details on collision
  checking are given below in :ref:`sect-itempick-collision-check-dep`
  :latex:`(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-collision-check-dep})`.


A grasp provided by the ItemPick and BoxPick components represents the recommended
pose of the TCP (Tool Center Point) of the suction gripper.
The grasp ``type`` is always set to ``SUCTION``.
The computed grasp pose is the center of the biggest ellipse that can be inscribed in
each surface.
The grasp orientation is a right-handed coordinate system and is defined such
that its z axis is normal to the surface pointing inside the object at the grasp position and
its x axis is directed along the maximum elongation of the ellipse.

.. _fig-itempick-grasp-surface:
.. figure:: images/itempick_grasp_surface.png
   :width: 300 px
   :align: center

   Illustration of suction grasp with coordinate system and ellipse representing
   the maximum suction surface.

Each grasp includes the dimensions of the maximum suction surface available,
modelled as an ellipse of axes ``max_suction_surface_length`` and
``max_suction_surface_width``. The user is enabled to filter grasps by specifying
the minimum suction surface required by the suction device in use.

In the BoxPick component, the grasp position corresponds to the center of the detected
rectangle and the dimensions of the maximum suction surface available matches the estimated
rectangle dimensions. Detected rectangles with missing data or occlusions by other objects for more
than 15% of their surface do not get an associated grasp.

Each grasp also includes a ``quality`` value, which gives an
indication of the flatness of the grasping surface.
The ``quality`` value varies between 0 and 1, where higher numbers correspond to a
flatter reconstructed surface.

.. In case of multi-cup suction devices, the suction surface
.. is expected to cover all suction elements.

The grasp definition is complemented by a ``uuid`` (Universally Unique Identifier)
and the ``timestamp`` of the oldest image that was used to compute the grasp.

.. _sect-itempick-dependencies:

Interaction with other components
---------------------------------

Internally, the ItemPick and BoxPick components depend on, and interact with other on-board
components as listed below.

.. Note::
  All changes and configuration updates to these components will affect
  the performance of the ItemPick and BoxPick components.

.. For each load carrier detection and grasp computation, the ItemPick component
.. acquires datasets of synchronized images and estimates the gravity vector.
.. The data acquisition step normally takes between 500 ms and 600 ms
.. with "High" depth image quality.

.. _sect-itempick-stereo-camera-matching:

Stereo camera and Stereo matching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ItemPick and BoxPick components make internally use of the following data:

- Rectified images from the :doc:`stereo_camera` component
  (``rc_stereocamera``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-stereo-camera}`);

- Disparity, error, and confidence images from the :doc:`stereo_matching` component
  (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`).

All processed images are guaranteed to be captured after the component trigger time.

.. _sect-itempick-dynamics:

Estimation of gravity vector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each load carrier detection and grasp computation, the components
estimate the gravity vector by subscribing to the |rc_visard|'s IMU data stream.

.. Note::
   The gravity vector is estimated from linear acceleration readings from the on-board IMU.
   For this reason, the ItemPick and BoxPick components require the |rc_visard| to remain
   still while the gravity vector is being estimated.

.. _sect-itempick-iocontrol-dep:

IO and Projector Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the |rc_xxx| is used in conjunction with an external random dot projector and
the :doc:`iocontrol` component (``rc_iocontrol``:latex:`, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol}`),
the output mode for the GPIO output in use should be set to ``ExposureAlternateActive``, as
explained in the :ref:`sect-iocontrol-params`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-iocontrol-params})`
of the :doc:`iocontrol` component.

No additional changes are required to use the ItemPick and BoxPick components
in combination with a random dot projector.

.. _sect-itempick-hand-eye-dep:

Hand-eye calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case the camera has been calibrated to a robot, the ItemPick and BoxPick components
can automatically provide poses in the robot coordinate frame.
For the ItemPick and BoxPick nodes' :ref:`sect-itempick-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick-services})`, the frame of the
output poses can be controlled with the ``pose_frame`` argument.

Two different ``pose_frame`` values can be chosen:

1. **Camera frame** (``camera``).
   All poses provided by the components are in the camera frame,
   and no prior knowledge about the pose of the camera in the environment is required.
   This means that the configured regions of interest and load carriers move with the camera.
   It is the user's responsibility to update the configured poses
   if the camera frame moves (e.g. with a robot-mounted camera).

2. **External frame** (``external``).
   All poses provided by the components are in the external frame,
   configured by the user during the hand-eye calibration process.
   The component relies on the on-board 
   :doc:`Hand-eye calibration component<handeye_calibration>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})`
   to retrieve the sensor mounting (static or robot mounted) and
   the hand-eye transformation.
   If the mounting is static, no further information is needed.
   If the sensor is robot-mounted, the ``robot_pose`` is required
   to transform poses to and from the ``external`` frame.

.. Note::
   If no hand-eye calibration is available, all ``pose_frame`` values should be set to ``camera``.

All ``pose_frame`` values that are not ``camera`` or ``external`` are rejected.


.. _sect-itempick-collision-check-dep:

CollisionCheck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case a CollisionCheck license is available, the collision checking can be easily enabled for
grasp computation of the ItemPick and BoxPick components. For this, a gripper has to be
defined in the CollisionCheck component
(see :ref:`sect-collisioncheck-gripper`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-gripper})`).
The ID of this gripper can then be passed to the ``compute_grasps`` service call.
Then all detected grasp points are checked for collisions between the gripper geometry and the load carrier.
Only grasps which are collision free will be returned. However, the visualization images on the *ItemPick* or *BoxPick*
tab of the |webgui| also show colliding grasp points as black ellipses.

.. Warning::

   Collisions are checked only between the load carrier and the gripper, not the robot itself, the flange, other objects or
   the item located in the robot gripper.

The CollisionCheck module's run-time parameters affect the collision detection as described in
:ref:`CollisionCheck Parameters<sect-collisioncheck-parameters>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-parameters})`.

Optionally, a pre-grasp offset between the grasp point and the pre-grasp position
can be specified for collision checking. The pre-grasp offset is the offset from the grasp point to the pre-grasp
position in the grasp's coordinate frame.
If the pre-grasp offset is defined, the grasp will be detected as colliding
if the gripper is in collision with the load carriers at any point
during motion from the pre-grasp position to the grasp position (assuming
a linear movement) as shown in :numref:`fig-collision-check-pre-grasp-offset`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collision-check-pre-grasp-offset})`.

.. _sect-itempick-parameters:

Parameters
----------

.. index::
   single: BoxPick; parameters
   single: ItemPick; parameters

The ItemPick and BoxPick components are called ``rc_itempick`` and ``rc_boxpick``
in the |rest-api| and are represented by the *ItemPick* and *BoxPick* pages in the *Modules* tab of the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`. 
The user can explore and configure the ``rc_itempick`` and ``rc_boxpick``
component's run-time parameters, e.g. for development and testing, using the |webgui| or the

    reduced to define the region of interest for grasp computation.

``cluster_max_dimension`` (**Only for ItemPick**, *Cluster Maximum Dimension*)
    sets the diameter of the largest circle enclosing each 
    cluster in meters. Clusters larger than this value are filtered out 
    before grasp computation.

``cluster_max_curvature`` (*Cluster Maximum Curvature*)
    is the maximum curvature allowed within one cluster. The smaller this value, the more clusters will be split apart.

``clustering_patch_size`` (**Only for ItemPick**, *Patch Size*)
    is the size of the square patches the depth map is subdivided into during the first clustering step in pixels.

``clustering_discontinuity_factor`` (*Discontinuity Factor*)
    is the factor used to discriminate depth discontinuities within a patch. The smaller this value, the more clusters will be split apart.

``clustering_max_surface_rmse`` (*Maximum Surface RMSE*)
    is the maximum root-mean-square error (RMSE) in meters of points belonging to a surface.
