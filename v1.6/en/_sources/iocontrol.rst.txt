IO and Projector Control

The IOControl component allows reading the status of the general
purpose digital inputs and controlling the digital general purpose
outputs (

Wiring

). The outputs can be set to low or high, or configured to be high for
the exposure time of every image. Additionally, the outputs can be
configured to be high for the exposure time of every second image.

Note: The IOControl component is optional and requires the purchase
  of a separate

  license

  .

Parameters

The IOControl component is called "rc_iocontrol" in the REST-API. The
user can change the parameters via REST-API (

REST-API interface

) or GigE Vision using the DigitalIOControl parameters "LineSelector"
and "LineSource" (

Category: DigitalIOControl

).

Parameter overview

This component offers the following run-time parameters.

The rc_iocontrol component’s run-time parameters              Name
Type  Min  Max  Default  Description  out1_mode  string  -  -
ExposureActive  Low, High, ExposureActive, ExposureAlternateActive
out2_mode  string  -  -  Low  Low, High, ExposureActive,
ExposureAlternateActive

This component reports no status values.

Description of run-time parameters

"out1_mode" and "out2_mode" (
Out1

 and
Out2

)
   The output modes for GPIO Out 1 and Out 2 can be set individually:

   "Low" sets the ouput permanently to low. This is the factory
   default of Out 2.

   "High" sets the output permanently to high.

   "ExposureActive" sets the output to high for the exposure time of
   every image. This is the factory default of Out 1.

   "ExposureAlternateActive" sets the output to high for the exposure
   time of every second image.

Note: The parameters can only be changed if the IOControl license is
  available on the

  rc_visard

  . Otherwise, the parameters will stay at their factory defaults,
  i.e. "out1_mode" = "ExposureActive" and "out2_mode" = "Low".

Figure

Fig. 43

 shows which images are used for stereo matching and transmission via
GigE Vision in "ExposureActive" mode with a user defined frame rate of
8 Hz.


The mode "ExposureAlternateActive" is meant to be used when an
external random dot projector is connected to the GPIO Out 1 of the

rc_visard

. A side effect of setting output 1 to "ExposureAlternateActive" is
that the

stereo matching

 component only uses images if output 1 is high, i.e. projector is on.
The maximum framerate that is used for stereo matching is therefore
halve of the frame rate configured by the user (see

FPS

). All other components like

visual odometry

,

TagDetect

 and

ItemPick

 use images where the output is low, i.e. projector is off. Figure

Fig. 44

 shows an example.


Note: In "ExposureAlternateActive" mode, an image with output high
  (i.e. with projection) is always 40 ms away from an image with
  output low (i.e. without projection), regardless of the user
  configured frame rate. This needs to be considered when
  synchronizing disparity and camera images without projection in this
  special mode.

The functionality can also be controlled by the digital IO control
parameters of the GenICam interface (

Category: DigitalIOControl

).

Services

The IOControl component offers the following services.

"get_io_values"
   This service call retrieves the current state of the general
   purpose inputs and outputs. The returned time stamp is the time of
   measurement. The call returns an error if the

   rc_visard

    does not have an IOControl license.

   This service requires no arguments.

   This service returns the following response:

      {
        "in1": "bool",
        "in2": "bool",
        "out1": "bool",
        "out2": "bool",
        "return_code": {
          "message": "string",
          "value": "int16"
        },
        "timestamp": {
          "nsec": "int32",
          "sec": "int32"
        }
      }

   Possible return codes are shown below.

   Possible return codes of the get_io_values service call.      Code
   Description  0  Success  -2  Internal error  -9  License for
   iocontrol is not available

"save_parameters"
   With this service call, the component’s current parameter settings
   are persisted to the

   rc_visard

   . That is, these values are applied even after reboot.

   This service requires no arguments.

   This service returns no response.

"reset_defaults"
   Restores and applies the default values for this component’s
   parameters (“factory reset”).

   This service requires no arguments.

   This service returns no response.

   Warning: The user must be aware that calling this service causes
     the current parameter settings for the IOControl component to be
     irrecoverably lost.
