3D camera modules
=================

The |rc_xxx|'s 3D camera software consists of the following modules:

- :doc:`stereo_camera` (``rc_camera``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-stereo-camera}`)
   acquires stereo image pairs and performs planar rectification for using the
   stereo camera as a measurement device.
   Images are provided both for further internal processing by other modules
   and for external use as :ref:`GenICam image streams <sect-genicam>`.

- :doc:`stereo_matching` (``rc_stereomatching``:latex:`, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}`)
   uses the rectified stereo image pairs to compute 3D depth
   information such as disparity, error, and confidence images.
   These are provided as GenICam streams, too.

The :doc:`stereo_camera` and the :doc:`stereo_matching` modules, which
acquire stereo image pairs and compute 3D depth information such as disparity,
error, and confidence images, are also accessible via the |rc_xxx|'s
:doc:`GigE Vision/GenICam interface<gigevision>`.
