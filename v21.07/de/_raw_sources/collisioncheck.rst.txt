Introduction
------------

The CollisionCheck module is an optional on-board module of the |rcxxx| and is licensed with 
any of the modules |pick_modules| or |match_modules|. 
Otherwise it requires a separate CollisionCheck :ref:`license<sect-updating-license>`
:latex:`(Section \ref{maintenance:sect-updating-license})` to be purchased.

The module provides an easy way to check if a gripper is in collision with a load carrier or other detected objects 
(only in combination with |match_modules|). It is integrated
with the |pick_modules| and 
|match_modules| modules, but can 
be used as standalone product.

.. Warning::

   Collisions are checked only between the load carrier and the gripper, not the robot itself, the flange, other objects or
   the item located in the robot gripper. Only in combination with |match_modules|,
   and only in case the selected template contains a collision 
   geometry and ``check_collisions_with_matches`` is enabled in the respective detection module,
   also collisions between the gripper and other *detected* objects are checked.
   Collisions with objects that cannot be detected will not be checked.

.. _sect-collisioncheck-gripper:

Setting a gripper
------------------

The gripper is a collision geometry used to determine whether the grasp is in collision with the load carrier.
The gripper consists of up to 15 elements connected to each other.

At this point, the gripper can be built of elements of the following types:

 - ``BOX``, with dimensions ``box.x``, ``box.y``, ``box.z``.
 - ``CYLINDER``, with radius ``cylinder.radius`` and height ``cylinder.height``.

Additionally, for each gripper the flange radius, and information about the Tool Center Point (TCP) have to
be defined.

The configuration of the gripper is normally performed offline during the setup of the desired application.
This can be done via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` or the |rcxxx|
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`.

.. _sect-collisioncheck-flange:

Robot flange radius
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collisions are checked only with the gripper, the robot body is not considered.
As a safety feature, to prevent collisions between the load carrier and the robot, all grasps having any part of the
robot's flange inside the load carrier can be designated as colliding (see :numref:`fig-collision-check-gripper-flange-radius`).
This check is based on the defined gripper geometry and the flange radius value. It is optional to use
this functionality, and it can be turned on and off with the run-time parameter ``check_flange`` as described
in :ref:`sect-collisioncheck-parameters`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-parameters})`.

.. _fig-collision-check-gripper-flange-radius:
.. figure:: images/check_flange.*
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Case A would be marked as collision only if ``check_flange`` is true, because the robot's flange (red) is inside the 
   load carrier. Case B is collision free independent of ``check_flange``.


Creating a gripper via the |rest-api|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When creating a gripper via the :doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`,
each element of the gripper has a `parent` element, which defines how they are connected.
The gripper is always built in the direction from the robot flange to the TCP, and at least one element must
have 'flange' as parent. The elements' IDs must be unique and must not be 'tcp' or 'flange'.
The pose of the child element has to be given in the coordinate frame of the parent element.
In the |rest-api| representation, the coordinate frame of an element is always in its
geometric center. Accordingly, for a child element to be exactly below the parent element, the position of
the child element must be computed from the heights of both parent and child element
(see :numref:`fig-collision-check-gripper-frames-restapi`).

.. _fig-collision-check-gripper-frames-restapi:
.. figure:: images/gripper_frames_restapi.*
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Reference frames for gripper creation via the |rest-api|

The reference frame for the first element for the gripper creation is always the center of the robot's flange
with the z axis pointing outwards. Via the |rest-api| it is possible to create a gripper with a tree structure,
corresponding to multiple elements having the same parent element, as long as they are all connected.


Creating a gripper in the |webgui|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tab *CollisionCheck* on the |rcxxx| :ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`
offers a simplified interface to create grippers. It is possible to select
the type, the size, as well as the position of each element. In the |webgui|
representation the position of each element originates from the bottom of the parent element. Therefore, a child
element with position (0, 0, 0) will always be placed exactly below its parent element, irrespective of the
elements' heights. Grippers which have a tree structure or which have rotated elements
cannot be created via the |webgui|.

Calculated TCP position
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After gripper creation via the ``set_gripper`` service call, the TCP position in the flange coordinate
system is calculated and returned as ``tcp_pose_flange``.
It is important to check if this value is the same as the robot's true TCP position.

Creating rotationally asymmetric grippers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For grippers which are not rotationally symmetric around the z axis, it is crucial to ensure that the gripper is properly mounted,
so that the representation stored in the CollisionCheck module corresponds to reality.


Collision checking
------------------

.. _sect-collision-check-pre-grasp-offset:

Stand-alone collision checking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``check_collisions`` service call triggers collision checking between the chosen gripper and the provided load carriers
for each of the provided grasps. Checking collisions with other objects is not possible with the stand-alone ``check_collisions`` service.
The CollisionCheck module checks if the chosen gripper is
in collision with at least one of the load carriers, when the TCP of the gripper is positioned in the
grasp position. It is possible to check the collision with multiple load carriers simultaneously. The grasps
which are in collision with any of the defined load carriers will be returned as colliding.

The ``pre_grasp_offset`` can be used for additional collision checking.
The pre-grasp offset :math:`P_{off}` is the offset  between the grasp point :math:`P_{grasp}` and the pre-grasp position :math:`P_{pre}`
in the grasp's coordinate frame (see :numref:`fig-collision-check-pre-grasp-offset`).
If the pre-grasp offset is defined, the grasp will be detected as colliding
if the gripper is in collision at any point
during motion from the pre-grasp position to the grasp position (assuming
a linear movement).

.. _fig-collision-check-pre-grasp-offset:
.. figure:: images/pre_grasp_offset.*
   :width: 300 px
   :align: center

   Illustration of the pre-grasp offset parameter for collision checking. In this case, the pre-grasp position as
   well as the grasp position are collision free. However, the trajectory between these poses would have collisions.
   Thus, this grasp pose would be marked as colliding.

.. _sect-collision-check-other-modules:

Collision checking within other modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collision checking is integrated in the following modules' services:

.. only:: rc_visard

   - :ref:`sect-itempick`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick})`: ``compute_grasps``
     (see :ref:`compute_grasps for ItemPick<expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps>`:latex:`, Section \ref{itempick:expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps}` and 
     :ref:`compute_grasps for BoxPick<expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps-boxpick>`:latex:`, Section \ref{itempick:expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps-boxpick}`)

   - :ref:`sect-silhouettematch`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch})`: ``detect_object``
     (see :ref:`expl-silhouettematch-srv-detect-objects`:latex:`, Section \ref{silhouettematch:expl-silhouettematch-srv-detect-objects}`)

.. only:: rc_cube

   - :ref:`sect-itempick`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{itempick:sect-itempick})`: ``compute_grasps``
     (see :ref:`compute_grasps for ItemPick<expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps>`:latex:`, Section \ref{itempick:expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps}` and 
     :ref:`compute_grasps for BoxPick<expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps-boxpick>`:latex:`, Section \ref{itempick:expl-itempick-srv-compute-grasps-boxpick}`)

   - :ref:`sect-silhouettematch`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{silhouettematch:sect-silhouettematch})`: ``detect_object``
     (see :ref:`expl-silhouettematch-srv-detect-objects`:latex:`, Section \ref{silhouettematch:expl-silhouettematch-srv-detect-objects}`)
   
   - :ref:`sect-cadmatch`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch})`: ``detect_object``
     (see :ref:`expl-cadmatch-srv-detect-object`:latex:`, Section \ref{cadmatch:expl-cadmatch-srv-detect-object}`)

Each of these services can take a ``collision_detection`` argument consisting of the ``gripper_id`` of the gripper
and optionally the ``pre_grasp_offset`` as described in the previous section 
:ref:`sect-collision-check-pre-grasp-offset`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collision-check-pre-grasp-offset})`.
When the ``collision_detection`` argument is given, these services only return the 
grasps at which the gripper is not in collision with the load carrier detected by these services. For this,
a load carrier ID has to be provided to these services as well. Only for |match_modules|, and only in case the selected template contains a collision 
geometry and ``check_collisions_with_matches`` is enabled in the respective detection module, 
grasp points at which the gripper would be in collision with other *detected* objects are also rejected. The object
on which the grasp point to be checked is located, is excluded from the collision check.

.. Warning::

   Collisions are checked only between the load carrier and the gripper, not the robot itself, the flange, other objects or
   the item located in the robot gripper. Only in combination with |match_modules|,
   and only in case the selected template contains a collision 
   geometry and ``check_collisions_with_matches`` is enabled in the respective detection module,
   also collisions between the gripper and other *detected* objects are checked.
   Collisions with objects that cannot be detected will not be checked.

The collision-check results are affected by run-time parameters, which are listed
and explained further below.

Parameters
----------

The CollisionCheck module is called ``rc_collision_check``
in the |rest-api| and is represented by the *CollisionCheck* page in the *Configuration* tab of the
:ref:`Web GUI<sect-web-gui>`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`. 
The user can explore and configure the ``rc_collision_check``
module's run-time parameters, e.g. for development and testing, using the |webgui| or the
:doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`.

.. _sect-collisioncheck-parameters:

Parameter overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: _gen/nodes/params/rc_collision_check.txt


Description of run-time parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each run-time parameter is represented by a row on the |webgui|'s Module tab.
The name in the |webgui| is given in brackets behind the parameter name:

.. _expl-collisioncheck-collision-dist:

``collision_dist`` (*Collision Distance*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    Minimal distance in meters between any part of the gripper and any of the collision geometries (load carrier and/or detected objects) 
    for a grasp to be considered collision free.

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

    .. code-block:: bash

       PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_collision_check/parameters?collision_dist=<value>

.. _expl-collisioncheck-check-flange:

``check_flange`` (*Check Flange*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    Performs an additional safety check as described in
    :ref:`sect-collisioncheck-flange`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-collisioncheck-flange})`.
    If this parameter is set, all positions in which any part of the robot's flange is inside the load carrier are marked as colliding.

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

    .. code-block:: bash

       PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_collision_check/parameters?check_flange=<value>

.. _expl-collisioncheck-check-bottom:

``check_bottom`` (*Check Bottom*)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    When this check is enabled the collisions will be checked not only with the side walls of the load carrier but also with its bottom. It might be necessary to disable this check if the TCP is inside the collision geometry (e.g. is defined inside a suction cup).

    Via the |restapi|, this parameter can be set as follows.

    .. code-block:: bash

       PUT http://<host>/api/v1/nodes/rc_collision_check/parameters?check_bottom=<value>

.. _sect-collisioncheck-status-values:

.. _sect-collisioncheck-services:

Services
--------

The user can explore and call the ``rc_collision_check`` module's services,
e.g. for development and testing, using
:doc:`rest_api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})` or
the |rc_xxx|
:ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})`.

Each service response contains a ``return_code``,
which consists of a ``value`` plus an optional ``message``.
A successful service returns with a ``return_code`` value of ``0``.
Negative ``return_code`` values indicate that the service failed.
Positive ``return_code`` values indicate that the service succeeded with additional information.
The smaller value is selected in case a service has multiple ``return_code`` values,
but all messages are appended in the ``return_code`` message.
