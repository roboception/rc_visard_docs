Stereo INS
==========

The stereo-vision-aided Inertial Navigation System (:term:`INS`) module 
is a base module which is available on every |rc_visard| and is part
of the sensor dynamics module. It combines visual-odometry measurements
with inertial measurement unit (:term:`IMU`) data and provides robust, low latency,
real-time state estimates at a high rate. The IMU consists of three
accelerometers and three gyroscopes, which measure accelerations and turn
rates in all three dimensions. By fusing IMU and visual-odometry measurements,
the state estimate has the same frequency as the IMU (|imu-rate|) and is
very robust even under challenging lighting conditions and for fast motions.

.. NOTE:: To achieve high-quality pose estimates, it must be ensured that sufficient
          texture is visible during runtime of the stereo INS module. In case
          no texture is visible for a longer period of time, the stereo INS module
          will stop instead of providing highly erroneous data.


Self-Calibration
----------------

During startup of the stereo INS module, it will self-calibrate the IMU
using the visual-odometry measurements. For the self-calibration to succeed, it
is required that

- the |rc_visard| is not moving and
- sufficient texture is visible

during startup of the stereo INS module. Failure to meet these requirements
will most likely result in a constant drift of the pose estimates.
