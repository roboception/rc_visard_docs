Hand-eye calibration
====================

.. index::
   pair: hand-eye calibration; robot frame
   pair: hand-eye calibration; external reference frame

For applications, in which the |rc_visard| is integrated into one or more
robot systems, it needs to be calibrated w.r.t. some robot
reference frames. For this purpose, the |rcvisard| is shipped with an on-board
calibration routine called the *hand-eye calibration* component.

.. note:: The implemented calibration routine is
   completely agnostic about the user-defined robot frame to which the |rcvisard| is
   calibrated. It might be a robot's end-effector (e.g., flange or tool
   center point) or any point on the robot structure.
   The method's only requirement is that the pose (i.e., translation and
   rotation) of this robot
   frame w.r.t. a user-defined external reference frame (e.g., world or robot
   mounting point) is exactly observable by the robot controller and can be
   reported to the calibration component.

The
:ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-procedure`
:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-procedure})`
itself is an easy-to-use three-step procedure using
a calibration grid.
To obtain proper results, an accurate calibration grid is
required. The grid can be simply printed and glued onto a flat surface.
A template with instructions is provided :download:`here <../calib/RoboceptionCalibGrid.pdf>`:latex:`: \url{http://www.roboception.com/download}`. Please follow the instructions
very carefully as calibration quality depends heavily on the grid's accuracy.


Calibration interfaces
----------------------

The following two interfaces are offered to conduct hand-eye
calibration:

#. All services and parameters of this component required to conduct the
   hand-eye calibration **programmatically** are exposed by the |rcvisard|'s
   :ref:`sect-rest-api`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{rest_api:sect-rest-api})`.
   The respective node name of this component is ``rc_hand_eye_calibration``
   and the respective service calls are documented
   :ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-services`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-services})`.

   .. note:: The described approach requires a network connection
         between the |rcvisard| and the robot controller to
         pass robot poses from the controller to the sensor's
         calibration component.

#. For use cases where robot poses cannot be passed programmatically to the
   |rcvisard|'s hand-eye calibration component, the
   :ref:`sect-web-gui`'s *Hand-Eye Calibration* tab
   :latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})` offers a guided
   process to conduct the calibration routine **manually**.

   .. note:: During the process, the described approach requires the user to
         manually enter into the |webgui| robot poses, which need to be accessed
         from the respective robot-teaching device or handheld.


.. _sect-handeyecalib-mounting:

Sensor mounting
---------------

.. index::
   pair: hand-eye calibration; mounting

As illustrated in :numref:`fig-sketch-handeyecalib-robot-mounted` and
:numref:`fig-sketch-handeyecalib-static`, two different use
cases w.r.t. to the mounting of the |rcvisard| generally have to be considered:

a. The |rcvisard| is **mounted on the robot**, i.e., it is mechanically
   connected at its mounting points (see
   :ref:`sect-installation`:latex:`, Section
   \ref{installation:sect-installation}`)
   to a robot link (e.g., at its flange or a flange-mounted tool), and
   hence moves with the robot.

#. The |rcvisard| is not mounted on the robot but is fixed
   to a table or other place in the robot's vicinity and remains at a **static** position
   w.r.t. the robot.

While the general
:ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-procedure`:latex:`\:(Section
\ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-procedure})` is very similar
in both use cases,
the calibration process's output, i.e., the resulting calibration transform,
will be semantically different, and the fixture of the calibration grid
will also differ.


Calibration with a robot-mounted sensor
   When calibrating a robot-mounted |rcvisard| with the robot, the calibration
   grid has to be secured in a static position w.r.t. the robot, e.g., on a table
   or some other fixed-base coordinate system as sketched in
   :numref:`fig-sketch-handeyecalib-robot-mounted`.

   .. warning:: It is extremely important that the calibration grid does not move
               during step 2 of the
               :ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-procedure`:latex:`\:(Section
               \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-procedure})`.
               Securely fixing its position
               to prevent unintended movements such as those caused by
               vibrations, moving cables, or the like is therefore strongly
               recommended.

   The result of the calibration (step 3 of the
   :ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-procedure`:latex:`, Section
   \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-procedure}`) is a pose
   :math:`\mathbf{T}^{\text{robot}}_{\text{camera}}`
   describing the
   (previoulsy unknown) relative positional and rotational transformation
   between the |rcvisard|'s
   *camera* frame and the user-selected *robot* frame such that

   .. math::
     :label: handeye-calib-robotmounted-result

     \mathbf{p}_{\text{robot}} =
         \mathbf{R} \left(\mathbf{T}^{\text{robot}}_{\text{camera}}\right)
         \cdot \mathbf{p}_{\text{camera}}
         + \mathbf{t} \left(\mathbf{T}^{\text{robot}}_{\text{camera}}\right)
         \:,

   where :math:`\mathbf{p}_{\text{robot}} = (x,y,z)^T` is a 3D-point
   with its coordinates expressed in the *robot* frame,
   :math:`\mathbf{p}_{\text{camera}}` is the same point represented in the
   *camera* coordinate frame, and :math:`\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{T})` as well as
   :math:`\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{T})` are the
   corresponding :math:`3\times 3` rotation matrix and :math:`3\times 1`
   translation vector to a  pose :math:`\mathbf{T}`, respectively.

      Important frames and transformations for calibrating a
      robot-mounted |rcvisard|: The sensor is mounted with a fixed relative
      position to a user-defined *robot* frame (e.g. flange or TCP). It is
      important that the pose :math:`\mathbf{T}^{\text{ext}}_{\text{robot}}` of
      this *robot* frame w.r.t. a user-defined external reference frame *ext*
      is observable during the calibration routine. The result of the calibration
      process is the desired calibration transformation
      :math:`\mathbf{T}^{\text{robot}}_{\text{camera}}`, i.e., the pose of the
      *camera* frame within the user-defined *robot* frame.


Calibration with a statically-mounted sensor
   In use cases where the |rcvisard| is positioned statically w.r.t. the
   robot, the calibration grid needs to be mounted to the robot as
   shown for example in :numref:`fig-sketch-handeyecalib-static` and
   :numref:`fig-sketch-handeyecalib-gridmount`.

   .. note:: The hand-eye calibration component is
      completely agnostic about the exact mounting and positioning of the
      calibration grid w.r.t. the user-defined *robot* frame. That is,
      the relative positioning of the calibration grid to
      that frame neither needs to
      be known, nor it is relevant for the calibration routine, as shown in
      :numref:`fig-sketch-handeyecalib-gridmount`.

   .. warning::
      It is extremely important that the calibration grid is attached
      securely to the robot such that it does
      not change its relative position w.r.t. the user-defined *robot* frame
      during step 2 of the :ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-procedure`:latex:`\:(Section
      \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-procedure})`.

      Securely preventing unintended position changes such as those
      caused by vibrations, for
      example by mounting the calibration grid itself on a wooden support (suggested
      thickness min. 1 cm), which can then be screwed to the robot structure, e.g.,
      its flange or tool, is therefore strongly recommended.

   In this use case, the result of the calibration (step 3 of the
   :ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-procedure`:latex:`, Section
   \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-procedure}`) is the pose
   :math:`\mathbf{T}^{\text{ext}}_{\text{camera}}`
   describing the
   (previoulsy unknown) relative positional and rotational transformation
   between the |rcvisard|'s
   *camera* frame and the user-selected external reference frame *ext*
   such that

   .. math::
     :label: handeye-calib-static-result

     \mathbf{p}_{\text{ext}} =
         \mathbf{R} \left(\mathbf{T}^{\text{ext}}_{\text{camera}}\right)

         + \mathbf{t} \left(\mathbf{T}^{\text{ext}}_{\text{camera}}\right)

   with its coordinates expressed in the external reference frame *ext*,
   :math:`\mathbf{p}_{\text{camera}}` is the same point represented in the
   *camera* coordinate frame, and :math:`\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{T})` as well as

Calibration routine
-------------------

.. index::
   pair: hand-eye calibration; calibration

The general hand-eye calibration routine consists of three steps, which are
illustrated in :numref:`fig-sketch-handeyecalib-procedure`.
These three steps
are also represented in the :ref:`sect-web-gui`'s
guided hand-eye-calibration process\ :latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`.

   Illustration of the three different steps involved in the hand-eye
   calibration routine

..
   Discussed with Heiko that we dont want to have this note!
   .. Note:: Before performing a hand-eye-calibration, please check the camera
         calibration as described in
         :ref:`sect-camera-calibration`:latex:`\:(Section
         \ref{camera_calibration:sect-camera-calibration})`.
         If re-calibration is necessary, perform the camera calibration first.


Step 1: Setting parameters
..........................

Before starting the actual calibration routine, the
grid size and sensor-mounting parameters have to be set to the component. As for
the |restapi|, the respective parameters are listed in
:ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-params`:latex:`\:(Section
\ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-params})`.

|Webgui| example:
   The |webgui| offers an
   interface for entering these parameters during the first step of the calibration
   routine as shown in :numref:`fig-handeyecalib-webgui1`. In addition to grid
   size and sensor mounting, the |webgui| also offers a *Pose* setting
   to be defined by the user. It specifies the format used for reporting the
   robot poses in the upcoming step 2 of the calibration process, either as
   *XYZABC* for positions and Euler angles, or *XYZ+quaternion* for positions
   plus quaternions for representing rotations.
   See :ref:`sect-pose-formats`:latex:`\:(Section
   \ref{pose_formats:sect-pose-formats})` for the exact definitions.

   .. note:: The *Pose* parameter is added to the |webgui| as a convenience
         option only. For reporting poses programmatically via |restapi|, the
         *XYZ+quaternion* format is mandatory.

   .. _fig-handeyecalib-webgui1:

      :width:  100 %
      :align: center

      Defining hand-eye calibration settings via the |rcvisard|'s |webgui|



Step 2:  Selecting and reporting robot calibration positions
............................................................

In this step (2a.), the user defines several calibration positions for the robot to
approach. These positions must each ensure that the
calibration grid is completely
visible in |rcvisard|'s left camera image. Furthermore, the robot positions
need to be selected properly to achieve a variety of different
perspectives
for the |rcvisard| to perceive the calibration grid.
:numref:`fig-handeyecalib-poses` shows a schematic recommendation of four
different view points.

.. _fig-handeyecalib-poses:
.. figure:: images/handeyecalib-alldraw.png
   :width: 70 %
   :align: center

   Recommended views on the calibration grid during the calibration procedure

.. warning:: Calibration quality, i.e., the accuracy of the
      calculated calibration result, depends on the calibration-grid views provided.
      The more diverse the perspectives are, the better
      is the calibration. Choosing very similar views, i.e., varying
      the robot positions only slightly between different repetitions
      of step 2a., may lead to inaccurate estimation of
      the desired calibration transformation.

.. index::
   pair: hand-eye calibration; slot

After the robot reaches each calibration position, the
corresponding pose :math:`\mathbf{T}^{\text{ext}}_{\text{robot}}`
of the user-defined *robot* frame in the user-defined
external reference frame *ext* needs to be reported
to the hand-eye calibration component (2b.). For this purpose, the component
offers different *slots* to store the reported poses and the
|rcvisard|'s corresponding left camera images. All filled slots will then be used to
calculate the desired calibration transformation between the |rcvisard|'s
*camera* frame and either the user-defined *robot* frame
(robot-mounted sensor) or the user-defined external reference frame *ext*
(static sensor).

.. NOTE:: To successfully calculate the hand-eye calibration
      transformation, at least three different robot calibration
      poses need to be reported and stored in slots.
      However, to prevent errors induced by possible
      inaccurate measurements, at least **four calibration poses are
      recommended**.

To transmit the poses programmatically, the component's |restapi|
offers the ``set_pose`` service call (see
:ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-services`:latex:`, Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-services}`).

|Webgui| example:
   After completing the calibration settings in step 1 and clicking
   *Next*, the |webgui| offers four different slots (*First View*,
   *Second View*, etc.) for the user to fill manually with robot poses.
   At the very top, a live stream from the camera is shown indicating
   whether the calibration grid is currently detected or not. Next to each
   slot, a figure suggests a respective dedicated viewpoint on the grid.
   For each slot, the robot must be operated to achieve the suggested view.

   .. figure:: images/webgui_hand_eye_calib2.png
      :width: 100 %
      :align: center

      First sample image in the hand-eye calibration process for a
      statically mounted |rcvisard|

   Once the suggested view is achieved, the
   user-defined *robot* frame's pose needs to be entered manually into the
   respective text fields, and the corresponding camera image
   is captured using the *Take Picture to Proceed* button.

   .. note:: The user's acquisition of robot pose data
      depends on the robot model and manufacturer -- it might be read from a
      teaching or handheld device, which is shipped with the robot.

   .. warning:: Please be careful to correctly and accurately enter the
         values; even small variations or typos may lead to
         calibration-process failure.

   This procedure is repeated four times in total. Complying to the
   suggestions to observe the grid from above, left, front,
   and right, as sketched in :numref:`fig-handeyecalib-poses`, in this
   example the following corresponding camera images have been sent to the
   hand-eye calibration component with their associated robot pose:

   .. figure:: images/handeyecalib-allpics.png
      :width: 100 %
      :align: center

      Recorded camera images as input for the calibration procedure



Step 3: Calculating and saving the calibration transformation
.............................................................

.. index::
   pair: error; hand-eye calibration

The final step in the hand-eye calibration routine consists of issuing the
desired calibration transformation to be computed from the collected
poses and camera images. The |restapi| offers this functionality via the
``calibrate`` service call 
(see :ref:`sect-handeye-calibration-services`:latex:`, Section \ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration-services}`). 
Depending on the way
the |rcvisard| is mounted, this service computes and returns the
transformation (i.e., the pose) between the *camera* frame and
either the user-defined
*robot* frame (robot-mounted sensor)
or the user-defined external reference frame *ext*
(statically mounted sensor); see
:ref:`sect-handeyecalib-mounting`:latex:`\:(Section
\ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeyecalib-mounting})`.

To enable users to judge the quality of the resulting calibration
transformation, the component also reports a
calibration error. This value is measured in pixels and denotes the root mean
square of the *reprojection error* averaged over all
calibration slots and all corners of the calibration grid.
However for a more intuitive understanding, this measurement might be
normalized by utilizing |rcvisard|'s focal length :math:`f` in pixels:

.. math::

  E = \frac{E_\text{camera}}{f}
      \:.


.. note::  The |rc_visard| reports a focal length factor via its various
      interfaces. It relates to the image width
      for supporting different image resolutions. The focal length :math:`f`
      in pixels can be easily obtained by multiplying the focal length factor
      by the image width in pixels.

The value :math:`E` can now be interpreted as an object-related error in meters
in the 3D-world. Given that the distance between the calibration grid and the
|rcvisard| is one meter, the *average* accuracy associated with transforming the grid's
coordinates from the *camera* frame to the target frame is
:math:`1\cdot E` m; assuming a distance of 0.5 meters, it measures
:math:`0.5\cdot E` m, etc.


|Webgui| example:
   The |webgui| automatically triggers computation of the calibration
   result immediately after taking the last of the four pictures.
   The user just needs to click the *Next* button to proceed to the result.
   In this
   example with a statically mounted |rcvisard|, the resulting output is the
   pose of the sensor's left camera in the world coordinate system of the
   robot -- represented in the *pose* format as specified in step 1 of
   the calibration routine.

   The reported error of :math:`E_\text{camera}=0.4` pixels in :numref:`fig-webgui-hand-eye-calibration-result` transforms
   into a calibration accuracy of
   :math:`E=\frac{E_\text{camera}}{f}\approx\frac{0.4}{1081.46}\approx 0.00036`,
   which is 0.36 mm at 1 meter distance -- a submillimeter accuracy for this calibration
   run.

The hand-eye calibration component is called ``rc_hand_eye_calibration`` in the |rest-api| and is
represented by the *Hand-Eye Calibration* tab in the :ref:`sect-web-gui`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{installation:sect-web-gui})`.
The user can change the calibration parameters there or use the

Parameter overview
..................

.. include:: _gen/nodes/params/rc_hand_eye_calibration.txt

Description of run-time parameters
..................................

The parameter descriptions are given with the corresponding |webgui| names in
brackets.

``grid_width`` (*Grid Width (m)*)
   Width of the calibration grid in meters. The width should be measured with
   a very great accuracy, preferably with sub-millimeter accuracy.

``grid_height`` (*Grid Height (m)*)
   Height of the calibration grid in meters. The height should be measured
   with a very great accuracy, preferably with sub-millimeter accuracy.

``robot_mounted`` (*Sensor Mounting*)
    If set to 1, the |rc_visard| is mounted on the robot.
    If set to 0, the |rc_visard| is mounted statically and the calibration grid is mounted on the robot.

(*Pose*)
   For convenience, the user can choose in the |webgui| between calibration in
   *XYZABC* format or in *XYZ+quaternion* format
   (see :ref:`sect-pose-formats`:latex:`,\:Section \ref{pose_formats:sect-pose-formats}`).
   When calibrating using the |rest-api|, the calibration result will always
   be given in *XYZ+quaternion*.

.. _sect-handeye-calibration-services:

Services
--------

The |rest-api| service calls offered to programmatically
conduct the
hand-eye calibration and to store or restore this component's parameters are
explained below.

``save_parameters``
   With this service call, the current parameter settings of the hand-eye
   calibration component are persisted to the |rcvisard|. That is,
   these values are applied even after reboot.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_hand_eye_calibration_save_parameters.txt

``reset_defaults``
   restores and applies the default values for this component's parameters
   ("factory reset"). Does not affect the calibration result itself or any
   of the ``slots`` saved during calibration. Only parameters such as the
   grid dimensions and the mount type will be reset.

   .. WARNING:: The user must be aware that calling this service causes the
      current parameter settings to be irrecoverably lost.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_hand_eye_calibration_reset_defaults.txt

``set_pose``
   provides a robot pose as calibration pose to the hand-eye calibration
   routine.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_hand_eye_calibration_set_pose.txt

   The ``slot`` argument is used to assign numbers to the different calibration
   poses. At each instant when ``set_pose`` is called, an image is
   recorded. This service call fails if the grid was undetectable in
   the current image.

``reset_calibration``
   deletes all previously provided poses and corresponding images.
   The last saved calibration result is reloaded.
   This service might be used to (re-)start the hand-eye calibration from scratch.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_hand_eye_calibration_reset_calibration.txt

``calibrate``
   calculates and returns the hand-eye calibration transformation with the
   robot poses configured by the ``set_pose`` service.

   .. NOTE:: For calculating the hand-eye calibration
      transformation at least three robot calibration poses are
      required (see ``set_pose`` service). However, four
      calibration poses are recommended.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_hand_eye_calibration_calibrate.txt

``save_calibration``
   saves the result of hand-eye calibration to the |rcvisard| and overwrites
   the existing one. The stored result can be retrieved any time by the
   ``get_calibration`` service.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_hand_eye_calibration_save_calibration.txt

``get_calibration``
   returns the hand-eye calibration currently stored on the |rc_visard|.

   .. include:: _gen/nodes/services/rc_hand_eye_calibration_get_calibration.txt
